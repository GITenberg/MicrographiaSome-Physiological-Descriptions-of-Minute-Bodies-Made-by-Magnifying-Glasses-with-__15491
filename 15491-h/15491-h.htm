  <i>disadvantages</i>, the <i>meanness</i> of the <i>Author</i>, and of
  the <i>Subject</i>; yet in both I am <i>incouraged</i> by the
  <i>greatness</i> of your <i>Mercy</i> and your <i>Knowledge</i>. By the
  <i>one</i> I am taught, that you can <i>forgive</i> the most
  <i>presumptuous Offendors</i>: And by the <i>other</i>, that you will not
  <i>esteem</i> the least work of <i>Nature</i>, or <i>Art</i>, unworthy
  your <i>Observation</i>. Amidst the many <i>felicities</i> that have
  accompani'd <i>your Majesties</i> happy <i>Restauration</i> and
  <i>Government</i>, it is none of the least considerable that
  <i>Philosophy</i> and <i>Experimental Learning</i> have <i>prosper'd</i>
  under your <i>Royal Patronage</i>. And as the calm prosperity of your
  Reign has given us the <i>leisure</i> to follow these <i>Studies</i> of
  <i>quiet</i> and <i>retirement</i>, so it is just, that the <i>Fruits</i>
  of them should, by way of <i>acknowledgement</i>, be return'd to <i>your

  my <i>Address</i> to our <i>Great Founder</i> and <i>Patron</i>,
  I could not but think my self oblig'd, in consideration of those <i>many
  Ingagements</i> you have laid upon me, to offer these my <i>poor
  Labours</i> to this MOST ILLUSTRIOUS ASSEMBLY. YOU have been pleas'd
  formerly to accept of these rude <i>Draughts</i>. I have since added to
  them some <i>Descriptions</i>, and some <i>Conjectures</i> of my own. And
  therefore, together with YOUR <i>Acceptance</i>, I must also beg YOUR
  <i>pardon</i>. The Rules YOU have prescrib'd YOUR selves in YOUR
  Philosophical Progress do seem the best that have ever yet been
  practis'd. And particularly that of avoiding <i>Dogmatizing</i>, and the
  <i>espousal</i> of any <i>Hypothesis</i> not sufficiently grounded and
  confirm'd by <i>Experiments</i>. This way seems the most excellent, and
  may preserve both <i>Philosophy</i> and <i>Natural History</i> from its
  former <i>Corruptions</i>. In saying which, I may seem to condemn my own
  Course in this Treatise; in which there may perhaps be some
  <i>Expressions</i>, which may seem more <i>positive</i> then YOUR
  Prescriptions will permit: And though I desire to have them understood
  only as <i>Conjectures</i> and <i>Quæries</i> (which YOUR Method does not
  altogether disallow) yet if even in those I have exceeded, 'tis fit that
  I should declare, that it was not done by YOUR Directions. For it is most
  unreasonable, that YOU should undergo the <i>imputation</i> of the
  <i>faults</i> of my <i>Conjectures</i>, seeing YOU can receive so
  <i>small advantage</i> of reputation by the <i>sleight Observations</i>
  of</p>

<p class="center"><i>YOUR most humble and<br />
most faithful Servant</i></p>

<h3>THE</h3>

<h1>PREFACE.</h1>

  <p><i><span title="Word with illuminated initial: It">
  <img align="left" src="images/illumined-I.png" alt="I" />t</span>
  is the great prerogative of Mankind above other Creatures, that
  we are not only able to </i>behold<i> the works of Nature, or barely to
  </i>sustein<i> our lives by them, but we have also the power of
  </i>considering<i>, </i>comparing<i>, </i>altering<i>, </i>assisting<i>,
  and </i>improving<i> them to various uses. And as this is the peculiar
  priviledge of humane Nature in general, so is it capable of being so far
  advanced by the helps of Art, and Experience, as to make some Men excel
  others in their Observations, and Deductions, almost as much as they do
  Beasts. By the addition of such </i>artificial Instruments<i> and
  </i>methods<i>, there may be, in some manner, a reparation made for the
  mischiefs, and imperfection, mankind has drawn upon it self, by
  negligence, and intemperance, and a wilful and superstitious deserting
  the Prescripts and Rules of Nature, whereby every man, both from a
  deriv'd corruption, innate and born with him, and from his breeding and
  converse with men, is very subject to slip into all sorts of
  errors.</i></p>

  <p><i>The only way which now remains for us to recover some degree of
  those former perfections, seems to be, by rectifying the operations of
  the </i>Sense<i>, the </i>Memory<i>, and </i>Reason<i>, since upon the
  evidence, the </i>strength<i>, the </i>integrity<i>, and the </i>right
  correspondence<i> of all these, all the light, by which our actions are
  to be guided is to be renewed, and all our command over things it to be
  establisht.</i></p>

  <p><i>It is therefore most worthy of our consideration, to recollect
  their several defects, that so we may the better understand how to supply
  them, and by what assistances we may </i>inlarge<i> their power, and
  </i>secure<i> them in performing their particular duties.</i></p>

  <p><i>As for the actions of our </i>Senses<i>, we cannot but observe them
  to be in many particulars much outdone by those of other Creatures, and
  when at best, to be far short of the perfection they seem capable of: And
  these infirmities of the Senses arise from a double cause, either from
  the </i>disproportion of the Object to the Organ<i>, whereby an infinite
  number of things can never enter into them, or else from </i>error in the
  Perception<i>, that many things, which come within their reach, are not
  received in a right manner.</i></p>

  <p><i>The like frailties are to be found in the </i>Memory;<i> we often
  let many things </i>slip away<i> from us, which deserve to be retain'd,
  and of those which we treasure up, a great part is either
  </i>frivolous<i> or </i>false<i>; and if good, and substantial, either in
  tract of time </i>obliterated<i>, or at best so </i>overwhelmed<i> and
  buried under more frothy notions, that when there is need of them, they
  are in vain sought for.</i></p>

  <p><i>The two main foundations being so deceivable, it is no wonder, that
  all the succeeding works which we build upon them, of arguing,
  concluding, defining, judging, and all the other degrees of Reason, are
  lyable to the same imperfection, being, at best, either vain, or
  uncertain: So that the errors of the </i>understanding<i> are answerable
  to the two other, being defective both in the quantity and goodness of
  its knowledge; for the limits, to which our thoughts are confin'd, are
  small in respect of the vast extent of Nature it self; some parts of it
  are </i>too large<i> to be comprehended, and some </i>too little<i> to be
  perceived. And from thence it must follow, that not having a full
  sensation of the Object, we must be very lame and imperfect in our
  conceptions about it, and in all the proportions which we build upon it;
  hence, we often take the </i>shadow<i> of things for the
  </i>substance<i>, small </i>appearances<i> for good </i>similitudes<i>,
  </i>similitudes<i> for </i>definitions;<i> and even many of those, which
  we think, to be the most solid definitions, are rather expressions of our
  own misguided apprehensions then of the true nature of the things
  themselves.</i></p>

  <p><i>The effects of these imperfections are manifested in different
  ways, according to the temper and disposition of the several minds of
  men, some they incline to </i>gross ignorance<i> and stupidity, and
  others to a </i>presumptuous imposing<i> on other mens Opinions, and a
  </i>confident dogmatizing<i> on matters, whereof there it no assurance to
  be given.</i></p>

  <p><i>Thus all the uncertainty, and mistakes of humane actions, proceed
  either from the narrowness and wandring of our </i>Senses<i>, from the
  slipperiness or delusion of our </i>Memory<i>, from the confinement or
  rashness of our </i>Understanding<i>, so that 'tis no wonder, that our
  power over natural causes and effects is so slowly improv'd, seeing we
  are not only to contend with the obscurity and </i>difficulty of the
  things<i> whereon we work and think, but even the </i>forces of our own
  minds<i> conspire to betray us.</i></p>

  <p><i>These being the dangers in the process of humane Reason, the
  remedies of them all can only proceed from the </i>real<i>, the
  </i>mechanical<i>, the </i>experimental<i> Philosophy, which has this
  advantage over the Philosophy of </i>discourse<i> and </i>disputation<i>,
  that whereas that chiefly aims at the subtilty of its Deductions and
  Conclusions, without much regard to the first ground-work, which ought to
  be well laid on the Sense and Memory; so this intends the right ordering
  of them all, and the making them serviceable to each other.</i></p>

  <p><i>The first thing to be undertaken in this weighty work, is a
  </i>watchfulness over the failings<i> and an </i>inlargement of the
  dominion<i>, of the Senses.</i></p>

  <p><i>To which end it is requisite, first, That there should be a
  </i>scrupulous<i> choice, and a </i>strict examination<i>, of the
  reality, constancy, and certainty of the Particulars that we admit: This
  is the first rise whereon truth is to begin, and here the most severe,
  and most impartial diligence, must be imployed; the storing up of all,
  without any regard to evidence or use, will only tend to darkness and
  confusion. We must not therefore esteem the riches of our Philosophical
  treasure by the </i>number<i> only, but chiefly by the </i>weight<i>; the
  most </i>vulgar<i> Instances are not to be neglected, but above all, the
  most </i>instructive<i> are to be entertain'd; the footsteps of Nature
  are to be trac'd, not only in her </i>ordinary course<i>, but when she
  seems to be put to her shifts, to make many </i>doublings<i> and
  </i>turnings<i>, and to use some kind of art in indeavouring to avoid our
  discovery.</i></p>

  <p><i>The next care to be taken, in respect of the Senses, is a supplying
  of their infirmities with </i>Instruments<i>, and, as it were, the adding
  of </i>artificial Organs<i> to the </i>natural<i>; this in one of them
  has been of late years accomplisht with prodigious benefit to all sorts
  of useful knowledge, by the invention of Optical Glasses. By the means of
  </i>Telescopes<i>, there is nothing so </i>far distant<i> but may be
  represented to our view; and by the help of </i>Microscopes<i>, there is
  nothing so </i>small<i>, as to escape our inquiry; hence there is a new
  visible World discovered to the understanding. By this means the Heavens
  are open'd, and a vast number of new Stars, and new Motions, and new
  Productions appear in them, to which all the ancient Astronomers were
  utterly Strangers. By this the Earth it self, which lyes so neer us,
  under our feet, shews quite a new thing to us, and in every </i>little
  particle<i> of its matter; we now behold almost as great a variety of
  Creatures, as we were able before to reckon up in the whole
  </i>Universe<i> it self.</i></p>

  <p><i>It seems not improbable, but that by these helps the subtilty of
  the composition of Bodies, the structure of their parts, the various
  texture of their matter, the instruments and manner of their inward
  motions, and all the other possible appearances of things, may come to be
  more fully discovered; all which the ancient </i>Peripateticks<i> were
  content to comprehend in two general and (unless further explain'd)
  useless words of </i>Matter<i> and </i>Form<i>. From whence there may
  arise many admirable advantages, towards the increase of the
  </i>Operative<i>, and the </i>Mechanick<i> Knowledge, to which this Age
  seems so much inclined, because we may perhaps be inabled to discern all
  the secret workings of Nature, almost in the same manner as we do those
  that are the productions of Art, and are manag'd by Wheels, and Engines,
  and Springs, that were devised by humane Wit.</i></p>

  <p><i>In this kind I here present to the World my imperfect Indeavours;
  which though they shall prove no other way considerable, yet, I hope,
  they may be in some measure useful to the main Design of a
  </i>reformation<i> in Philosophy, if it be only by shewing, that there it
  not so much requir'd towards it, any strength of </i>Imagination<i>, or
  exactness of </i>Method<i>, or depth of </i>Contemplation<i> (though the
  addition of these, where they can be had, must needs produce a much more
  perfect composure) as a sincere </i>Hand<i>, and a </i>faithful<i> Eye,
  to examine, and to record, the things themselves as they appear.</i></p>

  <p><i>And I beg my Reader, to let me take the boldness to assure him,
  that in this present condition of knowledge, a man so qualified, as I
  have indeavoured to be, only with resolution, and integrity, and plain
  intentions of imploying his </i>Senses<i> aright, may venture to compare
  the reality and the usefulness of his services, towards the true
  Philosophy, with those of other men, that are of much stronger, and more
  acute </i>speculations<i>, that shall not make use of the same method by
  the Senses.</i></p>

  <p><i>The truth is, the Science of Nature has been already too long made
  only a work of the </i>Brain<i> and the </i>Fancy<i>: It is now high time
  that it should return to the plainness and soundness of
  </i>Observations<i> on </i>material<i> and </i>obvious<i> things. It is
  said of great Empires, That </i>the best way to preserve them from decay,
  is to bring them back to the first Principles, and Arts, on which they
  did begin<i>. The same is undoubtedly true in Philosophy, that by
  wandring far away into </i>invisible Notions<i>, has almost quite
  destroy'd it self, and it can never be recovered, or continued, but by
  returning into the same </i>sensible paths<i>, in which it did at first
  proceed.</i></p>

  <p><i>If therefore the Reader expects from me any infallible Deductions,
  or certainty of </i>Axioms<i>, I am to say for my self, that those
  stronger Works of Wit and Imagination are above my weak Abilities; or if
  they had not been so, I would not have made use of them in this present
  Subject before me: Whenever he finds that I have ventur'd at any small
  Conjectures, at the causes of the things that I have observed, I beseech
  him to look, upon them only as </i>doubtful Problems<i>, and
  </i>uncertain ghesses<i>, and not as unquestionable Conclusions, or
  matters of unconfutable Science; I have produced nothing here, with
  intent to bind his understanding to an </i>implicit<i> consent; I am so
  far from that, that I desire him, not absolutely to rely upon these
  Observations of my eyes, if he finds them contradicted by the future
  Ocular Experiments of other and impartial Discoverers.</i></p>

  <p><i>As for my part, I have obtained my end, if these my small Labours
  shall be thought fit to take up some place in the large stock, of
  </i>natural Observations<i>, which so many hands are busie in providing.
  If I have contributed the </i>meanest foundations<i> whereon others may
  raise nobler </i>Superstructures<i>, I am abundantly satisfied; and all
  my ambition is, that I may serve to the great Philosophers of this Age,
  as the makers and the grinders of my Glasses did to me; that I may
  prepare and furnish them with some </i>Materials<i>, which they may
  afterwards </i>order<i> and </i>manage<i> with better skill, and to far
  greater advantage.</i></p>

  <p><i>The next remedies in this universal cure of the Mind are to be
  applyed to the </i>Memory<i>, and they are to consist of such Directions
  as may inform us, what things are best to be </i>stor'd up<i> for our
  purpose, and which is the best way of so </i>disposing<i> them, that they
  may not only be </i>kept in safety<i>, but ready and convenient, to be at
  any time </i>produc'd<i> for use, as occasion shall require. But I will
  not here prevent my self in what I may say in another Discourse, wherein
  I shall make an attempt to propose some Considerations of the manner of
  compiling a Natural and Artificial History, and of so ranging and
  registring its Particulars into Philosophical Tables, as may make them
  most useful for the raising of </i>Axioms<i> and </i>Theories<i>.</i></p>

  <p><i>The last indeed is the most </i>hazardous<i> Enterprize, and yet
  the most </i>necessary<i>; and that is, to take such care that the
  </i>Judgment<i> and the </i>Reason<i> of Man (which is the third Faculty
  to be repair'd and improv'd) should receive such assistance, as to avoid
  the dangers to which it it by nature most subject. The Imperfections,
  which I have already mention'd, to which it is lyable, do either belong
  to the </i>extent<i>, or the </i>goodness<i> of its knowledge; and here
  the difficulty is the greater, least that which may be thought a
  </i>remedy<i> for the one should prove </i>destructive<i> to the other,
  least by seeking to inlarge our Knowledge, we should render it weak, and
  uncertain; and least by being too scrupulous and exact about every
  Circumstance of it, we should confine and streighten it too much.</i></p>

  <p><i>In both these the middle wayes are to be taken, nothing it to
  be</i> omitted<i>, and yet every thing to pass a </i>mature
  deliberation<i>: No </i>Intelligence<i> from Men of all Professions, and
  quarters of the World, to be </i>slighted<i>, and yet all to be so
  </i>severely examin'd<i>, that there remain no room for doubt or
  instability; much </i>rigour<i> in admitting, much </i>strictness<i> in
  comparing, and above all, much </i>slowness<i> in debating, and
  </i>shyness<i> in determining, is to be practised. The
  </i>Understanding<i> is to </i>order<i> all the inferiour services of the
  lower Faculties; but yet it is to do this only as a </i>lawful Master<i>,
  and not at a </i>Tyrant.<i> It must not </i>incroach<i> upon their
  Offices, nor take upon it self the employments which belong to either of
  them. It must </i>watch<i> the irregularities of the Senses, but it must
  not go before them, or </i>prevent<i> their information. It must
  </i>examine<i>, </i>range<i>, and </i>dispose<i> of the bank which it
  laid up in the Memory: but it must be sure to make </i>distinction<i>
  between the </i>sober<i> and </i>well collected heap<i>, and the
  </i>extravagant Ideas<i>, and </i>mistaken Images<i>, which there it may
  sometimes light upon. So many are the </i>links<i>, upon which the true
  Philosophy depends, of which, if any one be </i>loose<i>, or </i>weak<i>,
  the whole </i>chain<i> is in danger of being dissolv'd; it is to
  </i>begin<i> with the Hands and Eyes, and to </i>proceed<i> on through
  the Memory, to be </i>continued<i> by the Reason; nor is it to stop
  there, but to </i>come about<i> to the Hands and Eyes again, and so, by a
  </i>continual passage round<i> from one Faculty to another, it is to be
  maintained in life and strength, as much as the body of man it by the
  </i>circulation<i> of the blood through the several parts of the body,
  the Arms, the Feet, the Lungs, the Heart, and the Head.</i></p>

  <p><i>If once this method were followed with diligence and attention,
  there is nothing that lyes within the power of human Wit (or which is far
  more effectual) of human Industry, which we might not compass; we might
  not only hope for Inventions to equalize those of </i>Copernicus<i>,
  </i>Galileo<i>, </i>Gilbert<i>, </i>Harvy<i>, and of others, whose Names
  are almost lost, that were the Inventors of </i>Gun-powder<i>, the
  </i>Seamans Compass<i>, </i>Printing<i>, </i>Etching<i>, </i>Graving<i>,
  </i>Microscopes<i>, </i>&amp;c.<i> but multitudes that may far exceed
  them: for even those discoveries seem to have been the products of some
  such method, though but imperfect; What may not be therefore expected
  from it if thoroughly prosecuted? </i>Talking<i> and </i>contention of
  Arguments<i> would soon be turn'd into </i>labours<i>; all the fine
  </i>dreams<i> of Opinions, and </i>universal metaphysical natures<i>,
  which the luxury of subtil Brains has devis'd, would quickly vanish, and
  give place to </i>solid Histories<i>, </i>Experiments<i> and
  </i>Works.<i> And as at first, mankind </i>fell<i> by </i>tasting<i> of
  the forbidden Tree of Knowledge, so we, their Posterity, may be in part
  </i>restor'd<i> by the same way, not only by </i>beholding<i> and
  </i>contemplating<i>, but by </i>tasting<i> too those fruits of Natural
  knowledge, that were never yet forbidden.</i></p>

  <p><i>From hence the World may be assisted with </i>variety<i> of
  Inventions, </i>new<i> matter for Sciences may be </i>collected<i>, the
  </i>old improv'd<i>, and their </i>rust<i> rubb'd away; and as it is by
  the benefit of Senses that we receive all our Skill in the works of
  Nature, so they also may be wonderfully benefited by it, and may be
  guided to an easier and more exact performance of their Offices; 'tis not
  unlikely, but that we may find out wherein our Senses are deficient, and
  as easily find wayes of repairing them.</i></p>

  <p><i>The Indeavours of Skilful men have been most conversant about the
  assistance of the Eye, and many noble Productions have followed upon it;
  and from hence we may conclude, that there it a way open'd for advancing
  the operations, not only of all the other Senses, but even of the Eye it
  self; that which has been already done ought not to content us, but
  rather to incourage us to proceed further, and to attempt greater things
  in the same, and different wayes.</i></p>

  <p><i>'Tis not unlikely, but that there may be yet invented several other
  helps for the eye, at much exceeding those already found, as those do the
  bare eye, such as by which we may perhaps be able to discover </i>living
  Creatures<i> in the Moon, or other Planets, the </i>figures<i> of the
  compounding Particles of matter, and the particular </i>Schematisms<i>
  and </i>Textures<i> of Bodies.</i></p>

  <p><i>And as </i>Glasses<i> have highly promoted our </i>seeing<i>, so
  'tis not improbable, but that there may be found many </i>Mechanical
  Inventions<i> to improve our other Senses, of </i>hearing<i>,
  </i>smelling<i>, </i>tasting<i>, </i>touching.<i> 'Tis not impossible to
  hear a </i>whisper<i> a </i>furlongs<i> distance, it having been already
  done; and perhaps the nature of the thing would not make it more
  impossible, though that furlong should be ten times multiply'd. And
  though some famous Authors have affirm'd it impossible to hear through
  the </i>thinnest plate<i> of </i>Muscovy-glass<i>; yet I know a way, by
  which 'tis easie enough to hear one speak through a </i>wall a yard
  thick<i>. It has not been yet thoroughly examin'd, how far
  </i>Otocousticons<i> may be improv'd, nor what other wayes there may be
  of </i>quickning<i> our hearing, or </i>conveying<i> sound through
  </i>other bodies<i> then the </i>Air<i>: for that that it not the only
  </i>medium<i>, I can assure the Reader, that I have, by the help of a
  </i>distended wire<i>, propagated the sound to a very considerable
  distance in an </i>instant<i>, or with as seemingly quick a motion as
  that of light, at least, incomparably swifter then that, which at the
  same time was propagated through the Air; and this not only in a straight
  line, or direct, but in one bended in many angles.</i></p>

  <p><i>Nor are the other three so perfect, but that </i>diligence<i>,
  </i>attention<i>, and many </i>mechanical contrivances<i>, may also
  highly improve them. For since the sense of </i>smelling<i> seems to be
  made by the </i>swift passage<i> of the </i>Air<i> (</i>impregnated<i>
  with the steams and </i>effluvia<i> of several odorous Bodies) through
  the grisly </i>meanders<i> of the Nose whose surfaces are </i>cover'd<i>
  with a very sensible </i>nerve<i>, and </i>moistned<i> by a
  </i>transudation<i> from the </i>processus mamillares<i> of the Brain,
  and some adjoyning </i>glandules<i>, and by the moist </i>steam<i> of the
  </i>Lungs<i>, with a Liquor convenient for the reception of those
  </i>effluvia<i> and by the adhesion and mixing of those steams with that
  liquor, and thereby affecting the nerve, or perhaps by insinuating
  themselves into the juices of the brain, after the same manner, as I have
  in the following Observations intimated, the parts of Salt to pass
  through the skins of Effs, and Frogs. Since, I say, smelling seems to be
  made by some such way, 'tis not improbable, but that some contrivance,
  for making a great quantity of Air pass quick through the Nose, might at
  much promote the sense of smelling, as the any wayes hindring that
  passage does dull and destroy it. Several tryals I have made, both of
  hindring and promoting this sense, and have succeeded in some according
  to expectation; and indeed to me it seems capable of being improv'd, for
  the judging of the constitutions of many Bodies. Perhaps we may thereby
  also judge (as other Creatures seem to do) what is wholsome, what poyson;
  and in a word, what are the specifick properties of Bodies.</i></p>

  <p><i>There may be also some other mechanical wayes found out, of
  sensibly perceiving the </i>effluvia<i> of Bodies; several Instances of
  which, were it here proper, I could give of Mineral steams and
  exhalations; and it seems not impossible, but that by some such wayes
  improved, may be discovered, what Minerals lye buried under the Earth,
  without the trouble to dig for them; some things to confirm this
  Conjecture may be found in </i>Agricola<i>, and other Writers of
  Minerals, speaking of the Vegetables that are apt to thrive, or pine, in
  those steams.</i></p>

  <p><i>Whether also those steams, which seem to issue out of the Earth,
  and mix with the Air (and so to precipitate some </i>aqueous<i>
  Exhalations, wherewith 'tis impregnated) may not be by some way detected
  before they produce the effect, seems hard to determine; yet something of
  this kind I am able to discover, by an Instrument I contriv'd to shew all
  the minute variations in the pressure of the Air; by which I constantly
  find, that before, and during the time of rainy weather, the pressure of
  the Air is less, and in </i>dry weather<i>, but especially when an
  </i>Eastern Wind<i> (which having past over vast tracts of Land is heavy
  with Earthy Particles) blows, it is much more, though these changes are
  varied according to very odd Laws</i>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Instrument is this. I prepare a pretty capaceous Bolt-head AB,
  with a small stem about two foot and a half long DC; upon the end of this
  D I put on a small bended Glass, or brazen <i>syphon</i> DEF (open at D,
  E and F, but to be closed with cement at F and E, as occasion serves)
  whose stem F should be about six or eight inches long, but the bore of it
  not above half an inch diameter, and very even; these I fix very strongly
  together by the help of very hard Cement, and then fit the whole Glass
  ABCDEF into a long Board, or Frame, in such manner, that almost half the
  head AB may lye buried in a concave Hemisphere cut into the Board RS;
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-01.png" target="_blank" name="prefref"><i>Schem.</i> 1.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 1.
</span>
  then I place it so on the Board RS, as is exprest in the first figure of
  the first Scheme; and fix it very firm and steady in that posture, so as
  that the weight of the <i>Mercury</i> that is afterwards to be put into
  it, may not in the least shake or stir it; then drawing a line XY on the
  Frame RT, so that it may divide the ball into two equal parts, or that it
  may pass, as 'twere, through the center of the ball. I begin from that,
  and divide all the rest of the Board towards UT into inches, and the
  inches between the 25 and the end E (which need not be above two or three
  and thirty inches distant from the line XY) I subdivide into Decimals;
  then stopping the end F with soft Cement, or soft Wax, I invert the
  Frame, placing the head downwards, and the Orifice E upwards; and by it,
  with a small Funnel, I fill the whole Glass with Quicksilver; then by
  stopping the small Orifice E with my finger, I oftentimes erect and
  invert the whole Glass and Frame, and thereby free the Quicksilver and
  Glass from all the bubbles or parcels of lurking Air; then inverting it
  as before, I fill it top full with clear and well strain'd Quicksilver,
  and having made ready a small ball of pretty hard Cement, by heat made
  very soft, I press it into the hole E, and thereby stop it very fast; and
  to secure this Cement from flying out afterward, I bind over it a piece
  of Leather, that is spread over in the inside with Cement, and wound
  about it while the Cement is hot: Having thus softned it, I gently erect
  again the Glass after this manner: I first let the Frame down edge-wayes,
  till the edge RV touch the Floor, or ly horizontal; and then in that
  edging posture raise the end RS; this I do, that if there chance to be
  any Air hidden in the small Pipe E, it may ascend into the Pipe F, and
  not into the Pipe DC: Having thus erected it, and hung it by the hole Q,
  or fixt it perpendicularly by any other means, I open the end F, and by a
  small <i>Syphon</i> I draw out the <i>Mercury</i> so long, till I find
  the surface of it AB in the head to touch exactly the line XY; at which
  time I immediately take away the <i>Syphon</i>, and if by chance it be
  run somewhat below the line XY, by pouring in gently a little
  <i>Mercury</i> at F, I raise it again to its desired height, by this
  contrivance I make all the sensible rising and falling of the
  <i>Mercury</i> to be visible in the surface of the <i>Mercury</i> in the
  Pipe F, and scarce any in the head AB. But because there really is some
  small change of the upper surface also, I find by several Observations
  how much it rises in the Ball, and falls in the Pipe F, to make the
  distance between the two surfaces an inch greater then it was before; and
  the measure that it falls in the Pipe is the length of the inch by which
  I am to mark the parts of the Tube F, or the Board on which it lyes, into
  inches and Decimals: Having thus justned and divided it, I have a large
  Wheel MNOP, whose outmost limb is divided into two hundred equal parts;
  this by certain small Pillars is fixt on the Frame RT, in the manner
  exprest in the Figure. In the middle of this, on the back side, in a
  convenient frame, is placed a small Cylinder, whose circumference is
  equal to twice the length of one of those divisions, which I find answer
  to an inch of ascent, or descent, of <i>Mercury</i>: This Cylinder I, is
  movable on a very small Needle, on the end of which is fixt a very light
  Index KL, all which are so pois'd on the Axis, or Needle, that no part is
  heavier then another: Then about this Cylinder is wound a small Clew of
  Silk, with two small steel Bullets at each end of it GH; one of these,
  which is somewhat the heavier, ought to be so big, as freely to move to
  and fro in the Pipe F; by means of which contrivance, every the least
  variation of the height of the <i>Mercury</i> will be made exceeding
  visible by the motion to and fro of the small Index KL.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>But this is but one way of discovering the </i>effluvia<i> of the
  Earth mixt with the Air; there may be, perhaps many others, witness the
  </i>Hygroscope<i>, an Instrument whereby the watery steams volatile in
  the Air are discerned, which the Nose it self is not able to find. This I
  have describ'd in the following Tract in the Description of the Beard of
  a wild Oat. Others there, are, may be discovered both by the Nose, and by
  other wayes also. Thus the </i>smoak<i> of burning </i>Wood<i> is
  </i>smelt<i>, </i>seen<i>, and sufficiently </i>felt<i> by the eyes: The
  </i>fumes<i> of burning </i>Brimstone<i> are </i>smelt<i> and discovered
  also by the destroying the Colours of Bodies, as by the </i>whitening of
  a red Rose<i>: And who knows, but that the Industry of man, following
  this method, may find out wayes of improving this sense to as great a
  degree of perfection at it is in any Animal, and perhaps yet
  higher.</i></p>

  <p><i>'Tis not improbable also, but that our </i>taste<i> may be very
  much improv'd either by </i>preparing<i> our taste for the Body, as,
  after eating </i>bitter<i> things, </i>Wine<i>, or other </i>Vinous
  liquors<i>, are more sensibly tasted; or else by </i>preparing<i> Bodies
  for our tast; as the dissolving of Metals with acid Liquors, make them
  tastable, which were before altogether insipid; thus </i>Lead<i> becomes
  </i>sweeter<i> then Sugar, and </i>Silver<i> more </i>bitter<i> then
  Gall, </i>Copper<i> and </i>Iron<i> of most </i>loathsome<i> tasts. And
  indeed the business of this sense being to discover the presence of
  dissolved Bodies in Liquors put on the Tongue, or in general to discover
  that a fluid body has some solid body dissolv'd in it, and what they are;
  whatever contrivance makes this discovery improves this sense. In this
  kind the mixtures of Chymical Liquors afford many Instances; as the sweet
  Vinegar that is impregnated with Lead may be discovered to be so by the
  affusion of a little of an </i>Alcalizate solution<i>: The bitter liquor
  of </i>Aqua fortis<i> and </i>Silver<i> may be discover'd to be charg'd
  with that Metal, by laying in it some plates of Copper: 'Tis not
  improbable also, but there may be multitudes of other wayes of
  discovering the parts dissolv'd, or dissoluble in liquors; and what is
  this discovery but a kind of </i>secundary tasting<i>.</i></p>

  <p><i>'Tis not improbable also, but that the sense of </i>feeling<i> may
  be highly improv'd, for that being a sense that judges of the more
  </i>gross<i> and </i>robust motions<i> of the </i>Particles<i> of
  </i>Bodies<i>, seems capable of being improv'd and assisted very many
  wayes. Thus for the distinguishing of </i>Heat<i> and </i>Cold<i>, the
  </i>Weather-glass<i> and </i>Thermometer<i>, which I have describ'd in
  this following Treatise, do exceedingly perfect it; by each of which the
  least variations of heat or cold, which the most Acute sense is not able
  to distinguish, are manifested. This is oftentimes further promoted also
  by the help of </i>Burning-glasses<i>, and the like, which collect and
  unite the radiating heat. Thus the </i>roughness<i> and </i>smoothness<i>
  of a Body is made much more sensible by the help of a </i>Microscope<i>,
  then by the most </i>tender<i> and </i>delicate Hand<i>. Perhaps, a
  Physitian might, by several other </i>tangible<i> proprieties, discover
  the constitution of a Body as well as by the </i>Pulse<i>. I do but
  instance in these, to shew what possibility there may be of many others,
  and what probability and hopes there were of finding them, if this method
  were followed; for the Offices of the five Senses being to detect either
  the </i>subtil<i> and </i>curious Motions<i> propagated through all
  </i>pellucid<i> or perfectly </i>homogeneous<i> Bodies; Or the more
  </i>gross<i> and </i>vibrative Pulse<i> communicated through the
  </i>Air<i> and all other convenient </i>mediums<i>, whether fluid or
  solid: Or the </i>effluvia<i> of Bodies </i>dissolv'd<i> in the
  </i>Air<i>; Or the </i>particles<i> of bodies </i>dissolv'd<i> or
  </i>dissoluble<i> in </i>Liquors<i>, or the more </i>quick<i> and
  </i>violent shaking motion<i> of </i>heat<i> in all or any of these:
  whatsoever does any wayes promote any of these kinds of </i>criteria<i>,
  does afford a way of improving some one sense. And what a multitude of
  these would a diligent Man meet with in his inquiries? And this for the
  helping and promoting the </i>sensitive faculty<i> only.</i></p>

  <p><i>Next, as for the </i>Memory<i>, or </i>retentive faculty<i>, we may
  be sufficiently instructed from the </i>written Histories<i> of </i>civil
  actions<i>, what great assistance may be afforded the Memory, in the
  committing to writing things observable in </i>natural operations<i>. If
  a Physitian be therefore accounted the more able in his Faculty, because
  he has had long experience and practice, the remembrance of which, though
  perhaps very imperfect, does regulate all his after actions: What ought
  to be thought of that man, that has not only a perfect </i>register<i> of
  his own experience, but it grown </i>old<i> with the experience of many
  hundreds of years, and many thousands of men.</i></p>

  <p><i>And though of late, men, beginning to be sensible of this
  convenience, have here and there registred and printed some few
  </i>Centuries<i>, yet for the most part they are set down very lamely and
  imperfectly, and, I fear, many times not so truly, they seeming, several
  of them, to be design'd more for </i>Ostentation<i> then </i>publique
  use<i>: For, not to instance, that they do, for the most part, omit those
  Experiences they have made, wherein their Patients have miscarried, it is
  very easie to be perceiv'd, that they do all along </i>hyperbolically
  extol<i> their own Prescriptions, and vilifie those of others.
  Notwithstanding all which, these kinds of Histories are generally
  esteem'd useful, even to the ablest Physitian.</i></p>

  <p><i>What may not be expected from the </i>rational<i> or </i>deductive
  Faculty<i> that is furnisht with such </i>Materials<i>, and those so
  readily </i>adapted<i>, and rang'd for use, that in a moment, at 'twere,
  thousands of Instances, serving for the </i>illustration<i>,
  </i>determination<i>, or </i>invention<i>, of almost any inquiry, may be
  </i>represented<i> even to the sight? How neer the nature of
  </i>Axioms<i> must all those </i>Propositions<i> be which are examin'd
  before so many </i>Witnesses<i>? And how difficult will it be for any,
  though never so subtil an error in Philosophy, to </i>scape<i> from being
  discover'd, after it has indur'd the </i>touch<i>, and so many other
  </i>tryals<i>?</i></p>

  <p><i>What kind of mechanical way, and physical invention also is there
  requir'd that might not this may be found out? The </i>Invention<i> of a
  way to find the </i>Longitude<i> of places is easily perform'd, and that
  to as great </i>perfection<i> as is desir'd, or to at great an
  </i>accurateness<i> as the </i>Latitude<i> of places can be found at Sea;
  and perhaps yet also to a greater certainty then that has been hitherto
  found, as I shall very speedily freely manifest to the world. The way of
  </i>flying<i> in the Air seems principally unpracticable, by reason of
  the </i>want of strength<i> in </i>humane muscles<i>; if therefore that
  could be suppli'd, it were, I think, easie to make twenty contrivances to
  perform the office of </i>Wings<i>: What Attempts also I have made for
  the supplying that Defect, and my successes therein, which, I think, are
  wholly new, and not inconsiderable, I shall in another place
  relate.</i></p>

  <p><i>'Tis not unlikely also, but that </i>Chymists<i>, if they followed
  this method, might find out their so much sought for </i>Alkahest<i>.
  What an </i>universal Menstruum<i>, which dissolves all sorts of
  </i>Sulphureous Bodies<i>, I have discover'd (which hat not been before
  taken notice of as such) I have shewn in the sixteenth
  Observation.</i></p>

  <p><i>What a prodigious variety of Inventions in </i>Anatomy<i> has this
  latter Age afforded, even in our own Bodies in the very </i>Heart<i>, by
  which we live, and the Brain, which is the seat of our knowledge of other
  things? witness all the excellent Works of </i>Pecquet<i>,
  </i>Bartholinus<i>, </i>Billius<i>, and many others; and at home, of
  Doctor </i>Harvy<i>, Doctor </i>Ent<i>, Doctor </i>Willis<i>, Doctor
  </i>Glisson<i>. In </i>Celestial Observations<i> we have far exceeded all
  the Antients, even the </i>Chaldeans<i> and </i>Egyptians<i> themselves,
  whose </i>vast Plains<i>, </i>high Towers<i>, and </i>clear Air<i>, did
  not give them so great advantages over us, as have over them by our
  </i>Glasses<i>. By the help of which, they have been very much outdone by
  the famous </i>Galileo<i>, </i>Hevelius<i>, </i>Zulichem<i>; and our own
  Countrymen, Mr. </i>Rook<i>, Doctor </i>Wren<i>, and the great Ornament
  of our Church and Nation, the </i>Lord Bishop of Exeter<i>. And to say no
  more in </i>Aerial Discoveries<i>, there has been a wonderful progress
  made by the </i>Noble Engine<i> of </i>the most Illustrious Mr. Boyle<i>,
  whom it becomes me to mention with all honour, not only as my particular
  Patron, but as the </i>Patron<i> of </i>Philosophy<i> it self; which he
  every day </i>increases<i> by his </i>Labours<i>, and </i>adorns<i> by
  his </i>Example<i>.</i></p>

  <p><i>The good success of all these </i>great Men<i>, and many others,
  and the now seemingly great </i>obviousness<i> of most of their and
  divers other Inventions, which from the beginning of the world have been,
  as 'twere, trod on, and yet not minded till these last </i>inquisitive<i>
  Ages (an Argument that there may be yet behind multitudes of the like)
  puts me in mind to recommend such Studies, and the prosecution of them by
  such methods, to the </i>Gentlemen<i> of our Nation, whose </i>leisure<i>
  makes them fit to </i>undertake<i>, and the </i>plenty<i> of their
  fortunes </i>to accomplish<i>, extraordinary things in this way. And I do
  not only propose this kind of </i>Experimental Philosophy<i> as matter of
  high </i>rapture<i> and </i>delight<i> of the mind, but even as a
  </i>material<i> and </i>sensible Pleasure<i>. So vast it the </i>variety
  of Objects<i> which will come under their Inflections, so many
  </i>different wayes<i> there are </i>of handling<i> them, so great is the
  </i>satisfaction<i> of </i>finding<i> out </i>new things<i>, that I dare
  compare the </i>contentment<i> which they will injoy, not only to that of
  </i>contemplation<i>, but even to that which most men prefer of </i>the
  very Senses themselves<i>.</i></p>

  <p><i>And if they will please to take any incouragement from so mean and
  so imperfect endeavours as mine, upon my own experience, I can assure
  them, without arrogance, That there has not been any inquiry or Problem
  in </i>Mechanicks<i>, that I have hitherto propounded to my self, but by
  a certain method (which I may on some other opportunity explain) I have
  been able presently to examine the possibility of it; and if so, as
  easily to excogitate divers wayes of performing it: And indeed it is
  possible to do as much by </i>this method<i> in </i>Mechanicks<i>, as by
  </i>Algebra<i> can be perform'd in </i>Geometry<i>. Nor can I at all
  doubt, but that the same method is as applicable to </i>Physical
  Enquiries<i>, and as likely to find and reap thence at plentiful a crop
  of Inventions; and indeed there seems to be no subject so barren, but may
  with this good husbandry be highly improv'd.</i></p>

  <p><i>Toward the prosecution of this method in </i>Physical Inquiries<i>,
  I have here and there </i>gleaned<i> up an </i>handful<i> of
  Observations, in the collection of most of which I made use of
  </i>Microscopes<i>, and some other </i>Glasses<i> and </i>Instruments<i>
  that improve the sense; which way I have herein taken, not that there are
  not multitudes of useful and pleasant Observables, yet uncollected,
  obvious enough without the helps of Art, but only to promote the use of
  Mechanical helps for the Senses, both in the surveying the already
  visible World, and for the discovery of many others hitherto unknown, and
  to make us, with the great Conqueror, to be affected that we have not yet
  overcome one World when there are so many others to be discovered, every
  considerable improvement of </i>Telescopes<i> or </i>Microscopes<i>
  producing new Worlds and </i>Terra-Incognita's<i> to our view.</i></p>

  <p><i>The Glasses I used were of our English make, but though very good
  of the kind, yet far short of what might be expected, could we once find
  a way of making Glasses Elliptical, or of some more true shape; for
  though both </i>Microscopes<i>, and </i>Telescopes<i>, as they now are,
  will magnifie an Object about a thousand thousand times bigger then it
  appears to the naked eye; yet the Apertures of the Object-glasses are so
  very small, that very few Rays are admitted, and even of those few there
  are so many false, that the Object appears </i>dark<i> and
  </i>indistinct<i>: And indeed these inconveniences are such, as seem
  inseparable from Spherical Glasses, even when most exactly made; but the
  way we have hitherto made use of for that purpose is so imperfect, that
  there may be perhaps ten wrought before one be made tolerably good, and
  most of those ten perhaps every one differing in goodness one from
  another, which is an Argument, that the way hitherto used is, at least,
  very uncertain. So that these Glasses have a double defect; the one, that
  very few of them are exactly true wrought; the other, that even of those
  that are best among them, none will admit a sufficient number of Rayes to
  magnifie the Object beyond a determinate bigness. Against which
  Inconveniences the only Remedies I have hitherto met with are
  these.</i></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, for <i>Microscopes</i> (where the Object we view is near and
  within our power) the best way of making it appear bright in the Glass,
  is to cast a great quantity of light on it by means of <i>convex
  glasses</i>, for thereby, though the aperture be very small, yet there
  will throng in through it such multitudes, that an Object will by this
  means indure to be magnifi'd as much again as it would be without it. The
  way for doing which is this. I make choice of some Room that has only one
  window open to the South, and at about three or four foot distance from
  this Window, on a Table, I place my <i>Microscope</i>, and then so place
  either a round Globe of Water, or a very deep clear<i> plano convex</i>
  Glass (whose convex side is turn'd towards the Window) that there is a
  great quantity of Rayes collected and thrown upon the Object: Or if the
  Sun shine, I place a small piece of oyly Paper very near the Object,
  between that and the light; then with a good large Burning-Glass I so
  collect and throw the Rayes on the Paper, that there may be a very great
  quantity of light pass through it to the Object; yet I so proportion that
  light, that it may not singe or burn the Paper. Instead of which Paper
  there may be made use of a small piece of Looking-glass plate, one of
  whose sides is made rough by being rubb'd on a flat Tool with very find
  sand, this will, if the heat be leisurely cast on it, indure a much
  greater degree of heat, and consequently very much augment a convenient
  light. By all which means the light of the Sun, or of a Window, may be so
  cast on an Object, as to make it twice as light as it would otherwise be
  without it, and that without any inconvenience of glaring, which the
  immediate light of the Sun is very apt to create in most Objects; for by
  this means the light is so equally diffused, that all parts are alike
  inlightned; but when the immediate light of the Sun falls on it, the
  reflexions from some few parts are so vivid, that they drown the
  appearance of all the other, and are themselves also, by reason of the
  inequality of light, indistinct, and appear only radiant spots.</p>

  <p>But because the light of the Sun, and also that of a Window, is in a
  continual variation, and so many Objects cannot be view'd long enough by
  them to be throughly examin'd; besides that, oftentimes the Weather is so
  dark and cloudy, that for many dayes together nothing can be view'd: And
  because also there are many Objects to be met with in the night, which
  cannot so conveniently be kept perhaps till the day, therefore to procure
  and cast a sufficient quantity of light on an Object in the night, I
  thought of, and often used this, Expedient.</p>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-01.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 1.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 5.
</span>
  <p>I procur'd me a small Pedestal, such as is describ'd in the fifth
  Figure of the first <i>Scheme</i> on the small Pillar AB, of which were
  two movable Armes CD, which by means of the Screws EF, I could fix in any
  part of the Pillar; on the undermost of these I plac'd a pretty large
  Globe of Glass G, fill'd with exceeding clear Brine, stopt, inverted, and
  fixt in the manner visible in the Figure; out of the side of which Arm
  proceeded another Arm H, with many joynts; to the end of which was
  fastned a deep plain <i>Convex glass</i> I, which by means of this Arm
  could be moved too and fro, and fixt in any posture. On the upper Arm was
  placed a small Lamp K, which could be to mov'd upon the end of the Arm,
  as to be set in a fit posture to give light through the Ball: By means of
  this Instrument duly plac'd, as is exprest in the Figure, with the small
  flame of a Lamp may be cast as great and convenient a light on the Object
  as it will well indure; and being always constant, and to be had at any
  time, I found most proper for drawing the representations of those small
  Objects I had occasion to observe.</p>

  <p>None of all which ways (though much beyond any other hitherto made use
  of by any I know) do afford a sufficient help, but after a certain degree
  of magnifying, they leave us again in the lurch. Hence it were very
  desirable, that some way were thought of for making the Object-glass of
  such a Figure as would conveniently bear a large Aperture.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>As for </i>Telescopes<i>, the only improvement they seem capable
  of, is the increasing of their length; for the Object being remote, there
  is no thought of giving it a greater light then it has; and therefore to
  augment the. Aperture, the Glass must be ground of a very large sphere;
  for, by that means, the longer the Glass be, the bigger aperture will it
  bear, if the Glasses be of an equal goodness in their kind. Therefore a
  six will indure a much larger Aperture then a three foot Glass, and a
  sixty foot Glass will proportionably bear a greater Aperture then a
  thirty, and will as much excel it also as a six foot does a three foot,
  as I have experimentally observ'd in one of that length made by Mr.
  </i>Richard Reives<i> here at </i>London<i>, which will bear an Aperture
  above three inches over, and yet make the Object proportionably big and
  distinct; whereas there are very few thirty foot Glasses that will indure
  an Aperture of more then two inches over. So that for </i>Telescopes<i>,
  supposing we had a very ready way of making their Object Glasses of
  exactly spherical Surfaces, we might, by increasing the length of the
  Glass, magnifie the Object to any assignable bigness. And for performing
  both these, I cannot imagine any way more easie, and more exact, then by
  this following Engine, by means of which, any Glasses, of what length
  soever, may be speedily made. It seems the most easie, because with one
  and the same Tool may be with care ground an Object Glass, of any length
  or breadth requisite, and that with very little or no trouble in fitting
  the Engine, and without much skill in the Grinder. It seems to be the
  most exact, for to the very last stroke the Glass does regulate and
  rectifie the Tool to its exact Figure; and the longer or more the Tool
  and Glass are wrought together, the more exact will both of them be of
  the desir'd Figure. Further, the motions of the Glass and Tool do so
  cross each other, that there is not one point of eithers Surface, but has
  thousands of cross motions thwarting it, so that there can be no kind of
  Rings or Gutters made either in the Tool or Glass.</i></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The contrivance of the Engine is, only to make the ends of two large
  <i>Mandrils</i> so to move, that the Centers of them may be at any
  convenient distance asunder, and that the <i>Axis</i> of the
  <i>Mandrils</i> lying both in the same plain produc'd, may meet each
  other in any assignable Angle; both which requisites may be very well

  perform'd by the Engine describ'd in the third Figure of the first
  <i>Scheme</i>: where AB signifies the Beam of a Lath fixt perpendicularly
  or Horizontally, CD the two Poppet heads, fixt at about two foot
  distance, EF an Iron <i>Mandril</i>, whose tapering neck F runs in an
  adapted tapering brass Collar; the other end E runs on the point of a
  Screw G; in a convenient place of this is fastned H a pully Wheel, and
  into the end of it, that comes through the Poppet head C, is screwed a
  Ring of a hollow <i>Cylinder</i> K, or some other conveniently shap'd
  Tool, of what wideness shall be thought most proper for the cize of
  Glasses, about which it is to be imploy'd: As, for Object glasses,
  between twelve foot and an hundred foot long, the Ring may be about six
  inches over, or indeed somewhat more for those longer Glasses. It would
  be convenient also and not very chargeable, to have four or five several
  Tools; as one for all Glasses between an inch and a foot, one for all
  Glasses between a foot and ten foot long, another for all between ten and
  an hundred, a fourth for all between a hundred and a thousand foot long;
  and if Curiosity shall ever proceed so far, one for all lengths between a
  thousand and ten thousand foot long; for indeed the principle is such,
  that supposing the <i>Mandrils</i> well made, and of a good length, and
  supposing great care be used in working and polishing them, I see no
  reason, but that a Glass of a thousand, nay of ten thousand foot long,
  may be as well made as one of ten; for the reason is the same, supposing
  the <i>Mandrils</i> and Tools be made sufficiently strong, so that they
  cannot bend; and supposing the Glass, out of which they are wrought, be
  capable of so great a regularity in its parts as to refraction: this
  hollow <i>Cylinder</i> K is to contain the Sand, and by being drove round
  very quick to and fro by means of a small Wheel, which may be mov'd with
  ones foot, serves to grind the Glass: The other <i>Mandril</i> is shap'd
  like this, but it has an even neck instead of a taper one, and runs in a
  Collar, that by the help of a Screw and a joynt made like M in the
  Figure, it can be still adjustned to the wearing or wasting neck: into
  the end of this <i>Mandril</i> is screwed a Chock N on which with Cement
  or Glew is fastned the piece of Glass Q that is to be form'd; the middle
  of which Glass is to be plac'd just on the edge of the Ring and the Lath
  OP is to be set and fixt (by means of certain pieces and screws the
  manner whereof will be sufficiently evidenc'd by the Figure) in such an
  Angle as is requisite to the forming of such a Sphere as the Glass is
  design'd to be of; the geometrical ground of which being sufficiently
  plain, though not heeded before, I shall, for brevities sake, pass over.
  This last <i>Mandril</i> to be made (by means of the former, or some
  other Wheel) to run round very swift also, by which two cross motions the
  Glass cannot chuse (if care be us'd) but be wrought into a most exactly
  spherical Surface.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>But because we are certain, from the </i>Laws of refraction<i>
  (which I I have experimentally found to be so, by an Instrument I shall
  presently describe) that </i>the lines of the angles of Incidence are
  proportionate to the lines of the angles of Refraction<i>, therefore if
  Glasses could be made of those kind of Figures, or some other, such as
  the most incomparable </i>Des Cartes<i> has invented, and demonstrated in
  his Philosophical and Mathematical Works, we might hope for a much
  greater perfection of Opticks then can be rationally expected from
  spherical ones; for though, </i>cæteris paribus<i>, we find, that the
  larger the </i>Telescope<i> Object Glasses are, and the shorter those of
  the </i>Microscope<i>, the better they magnify, yet both of them, beside
  such determinate dimensions, are by certain inconveniences rendred
  unuseful; for it will be exceeding </i>difficult<i> to make and
  </i>manage<i> a Tube above an </i>hundred foot long<i>, and it will be as
  difficult to </i>inlighten<i> an Object less then an hundred part of an
  inch distant from the Object Glass.</i></p>

  <p><i>I have not as yet made any attempts of that kind, though I know two
  or three wayes, which, as far as I have yet considered, seem very
  probable, and may invite me to make a tryal as soon as I have an
  opportunity, of which I may hereafter perhaps acquaint the world. In the
  Interim, I shall describe the Instrument I even now mention'd, by which
  the </i>refraction<i> of all kinds of Liquors may be most exactly
  measur'd, thereby to give the curious an opportunity of making what
  further tryals of that kind they shall think requisite to any of their
  intended tryals; and to let them see that the laws of Refraction are not
  only notional.</i></p>

</span>
  <p>The Instrument consisted of five Rulers, or long pieces placed
  together, after the manner exprest in the second Figure of the first
  <i>Scheme</i>, where AB denotes a straight piece of wood about six foot
  and two inches long, about three inches over, and an inch and half thick,
  on the back side of which was hung a small plummet by a line stretcht
  from top to bottom, by which this piece was set exactly upright, and so
  very firmly fixt; in the middle of this was made a hole or center, into
  which one end of a hollow cylindrical brass Box CC, fashion'd as I shall
  by and by describe, was plac'd, and could very easily and truly be mov'd
  to and fro; the other end of this Box being put into, and moving in, a
  hole made in a small arm DD; into this box was fastned the long Ruler EF,
  about three foot and three or four inches long, and at three foot from
  the above mention'd Centers PP was a hole E, cut through, and cross'd
  with two small threads, and at the end of it was fixt a small sight G,
  and on the back side of it was fixt a small Arm H, with a Screw to fix it
  in any place on the Ruler LM; this Ruler LM was mov'd on the Center B
  (which was exactly three foot distance from the middle Center P) and a
  line drawn through the middle of it LM, was divided by a Line of cords
  into some sixty degrees, and each degree was subdivided into minutes, so
  that putting the cross of the threads in E upon any part of this divided
  line, I presently knew what Angle the two Rules AB and EF made with each
  other, and by turning the Screw in H, I could fix them in any position.
  The other Ruler also RS was made much after the same manner, only it was
  not fixt to the hollow cylindrical Box, but, by means of two small brass
  Armes or Ears, it mov'd on the Centers of it; this also, by means of the
  cross threads in the hole S, and by a Screw in K, could be fastned on any
  division of another line of cords of the same radius drawn on NO. And so
  by that means, the Angle made by the two Rulers, AB and RS, was also
  known. The Brass box CC in the middle was shap'd very much like the
  Figure X, that is, it was a cylindrical Box stopp'd close at either end,
  off of which a part both of the sides and bottomes was cut out, so that
  the Box, when the Pipe and that was joyned to it, would contain the Water
  when fill'd half full, and would likewise, without running over, indure
  to be inclin'd to an Angle, equal to that of the greatest refraction of
  Water, and no more, without running over. The Ruler EF was fixt very fast
  to the Pipe V, so that the Pipe V directed the length of the Ruler EF,
  and the Box and Ruler were mov'd on the Pin TT, so as to make any
  desirable Angle with the Ruler AB. The bottom of this Pipe V was stop'd
  with a small piece of exactly plain Glass, which was plac'd exactly
  perpendicular to the Line of direction, or <i>Axis</i> of the Ruler EF.
  The Pins also TT were drill'd with small holes through the <i>Axis</i>,
  and through those holes was stretcht and fastned a small Wire. There was
  likewise a small Pipe of Tin loosly put on upon the end of V, and
  reaching down to the sight G; the use of which was only to keep any false
  Rayes of light from passing through the bottom of V, and only admitting
  such to pass as pierced through the sight G: All things being placed
  together in the manner describ'd in the Figure; that is, the Ruler AB
  being fixt perpendicular, I fill'd the Box CC with Water, or any other
  Liquor, whose refraction I intended to try, till the Wire passing through
  the middle of it were just covered: then I moved and fixt the Ruler FE at
  any assignable Angle, and placed the flame of a Candle just against the
  sight G; and looking through the sight I, I moved the Ruler RS to and
  fro, till I perceived the light passing through G to be covered, as
  'twere, or divided by the dark Wire passing through PP: then turning the
  Screw in K, I fixt it in that posture: And through the hole S, I observed
  what degree and part of it was cut by the cross threads in S. And this
  gave me the Angle of Inclination, APS answering to the Angle of
  Refraction BPE: for the surface of the Liquor in the Box will be alwayes
  horizontal, and consequently AB will be a perpendicular to it; the Angle
  therefore APS will measure, or be the Angle of Inclination in the Liquor;
  next EPB must be the Angle of Refraction, for the Ray that passes through
  the sight G, passes also perpendicularly through the Glass
  <i>Diaphragme</i> at F, and consequently also perpendicularly through the
  lower surface of the Liquor contiguous to the Glass, and therefore
  suffers no refraction till it meet with the horizontal surface of the
  Liquor in CC, which is determined by the two Angles.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>By means of this Instrument I can with </i>little trouble<i>, and a
  very small quantity of any </i>Liquor<i>, examine, most accurately, the
  </i>refraction<i> of it not only for one inclination, but for all; and
  thereby am inabled to make very accurate Tables; several of which I have
  also experimentally made, and find, that </i>Oyl of Turpentine<i> has a
  much greater Refraction then </i>Spirit of Wine<i>, though it be
  </i>lighter<i>; and that </i>Spirit of Wine<i> has a greater Refraction
  then </i>Water<i>, though it be lighter also; but that </i>salt Water<i>
  also has a greater Refraction then </i>fresh<i>, though it be
  </i>heavier<i>: but </i>Allum water<i> has a less refraction then common
  </i>Water<i>, though heavier also. So that it seems, as to the
  </i>refraction<i> made in a Liquor, the </i>specifick gravity<i> is of no
  efficacy. By this I have also found that look what </i>proportion <i>the
  </i>Sine<i> of the Angle of </i>one Inclination<i> has to the </i>Sine<i>
  of the Angle of </i>Refraction<i>, correspondent to it, the same
  </i>proportion<i> have all the </i>Sines<i> of other Inclinations to the
  </i>Sines<i> of their appropriate Refractions.</i></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My way for measuring how much a Glass magnifies an Object, plac'd at a
  convenient distance from my eye, is this. Having rectifi'd the
  <i>Microscope</i>, to see the desir'd Object through it very distinctly,
  at the same time that I look upon the Object through the Glass with one
  eye, I look upon other Objects at the same distance with my other bare
  eye; by which means I am able, by the help of a <i>Ruler</i> divided into
  inches and small parts, and laid on the <i>Pedestal</i> of the
  <i>Microscope</i>, to cast, as it were, the magnifi'd appearance of the
  Object upon the Ruler, and thereby exactly to measure the Diameter it
  appears of through the Glass, which being compar'd with the Diameter it
  appears of to the naked eye, will easily afford the quantity of its
  magnifying.</p>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-01.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 1.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 6.
</span>
  <p>The <i>Microscope</i>, which for the most part I made use of, was
  shap'd much like that in the sixth Figure of the first <i>Scheme</i>, the
  Tube being for the most part not above six or seven inches long, though,
  by reason it had four Drawers, it could very much be lengthened, as
  occasion required; this was contriv'd with three Glasses; a small Object
  Glass at A, a thinner Eye Glass about B, and a very deep one about C:
  this I made use of only when I had occasion to see much of an Object at
  once; the middle Glass conveying a very great company of radiating
  Pencils, which would go another way, and throwing them upon the deep Eye
  Glass. But when ever I had occasion to examine the small parts of a Body
  more accurately, I took out the middle Glass, and only made use of one
  Eye Glass with the Object Glass, for always the fewer the Refractions
  are, the more bright and clear the Object appears. And therefore 'tis not
  to be doubted, but could we make a<i> Microscope </i>to have one only
  refraction, it would, <i>cæteris paribus</i>, far excel any other that
  had a greater number. And hence it is, that if you take a very clear
  piece of a broken <i>Venice</i> Glass, and in a Lamp draw it out into
  very small hairs or threads, then holding the ends of these threads in
  the flame, till they melt and run into a small round Globul, or drop,
  which will hang at the end of the thread; and if further you stick
  several of these upon the end of a stick with a little sealing Wax, so as
  that the threads stand upwards, and then on a Whetstone first grind off a
  good part of them, and afterward on a smooth Metal plate, with a little
  Tripoly, rub them till they come to be very smooth; if one of these be
  fixt with a little soft Wax against a small needle hole, prick'd through
  a thin Plate of Brass, Lead, Pewter, or any other Metal, and an Object,
  plac'd very near, be look'd at through it, it will both magnifie and make
  some Objects more distinct then any of the great <i>Microscopes</i>. But
  because these, though exceeding easily made, are yet very troublesome to
  be us'd, because of their smallness, and the nearness of the Object;
  therefore to prevent both these, and yet have only two Refractions, I
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-01.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 1.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 4.
</span>
  provided me a Tube of Brass, shap'd much like that in the fourth Figure
  of the first <i>Scheme</i>; into the smaller end of this I fixt with Wax
  a good <i>plano convex</i> Object Glass, with the convex side towards the
  Object, and into the bigger end I fixt also with wax a pretty large plano
  <i>Convex</i> Glass, with the <i>convex</i> side towards my eye, then by
  means of the small hole by the side, I fill'd the intermediate space
  between these two Glasses with very clear Water, and with a Screw stopp'd
  it in; then putting on a Cell for the Eye, I could perceive an Object
  more bright then I could when the intermediate space was only fill'd with
  Air, but this, for other inconveniences, I made but little use of.</p>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-01.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 1.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 6.
</span>
  <p>My way for fixing both the Glass and Object to the Pedestal most
  conveniently was thus: Upon one side of a round Pedestal AB, in the sixth
  Figure of the first <i>Scheme</i>, was fixt a small Pillar CC, on this
  was fitted a small Iron Arm D, which could be mov'd up and down, and fixt
  in any part of the Pillar, by means of a small Screw E; on the end of
  this Arm was a small Ball fitted into a kind of socket F, made in the
  side of the Brass Ring G, through which the small end of the Tube was
  screw'd; by means of which contrivance I could place and fix the Tube in
  what posture I desir'd (which for many Observations was exceeding
  necessary) and adjusten it most exactly to any Object.</p>

  <p>For placing the Object, I made this contrivance; upon the end of a
  small brass Link or Staple HH, I so fastned a round Plate II, that it
  might be turn'd round upon its Center K, and going pretty stiff, would
  stand fixt in any posture it was set; on the side of this was fixt a
  small Pillar P, about three quarters of an inch high, and through the top
  of this was thrust a small Iron pin M, whose top just stood over the
  Center of the Plate; on this top I fixt a small Object, and by means of
  these contrivances I was able to turn it into all kind of positions, both
  to my Eye and the Light; for by moving round the small Plate on its
  center, could move it one way, and by turning the Pin M, I could move it
  another way, and this without stirring the Glass at all, or at least but
  very little; the Plate likewise I could move to and fro to any part of
  the Pedestal (which in many cases was very convenient) and fix it also in
  any Position, by means of a Nut N, which was screw'd on upon the lower
  part of the Pillar CC. All the other Contrivances are obvious enough from
  the draught, and will need no description.</p>

  <p><i>Now though this were the Instrument I made most use of, yet I have
  made several other Tryals with other kinds of Microscopes, which both for
  </i>matter<i> and </i>form<i> were very different from common spherical
  Glasses. I have made a </i>Microscope<i> with one piece of Glass, both
  whose surfaces were </i>plains<i>. I have made another only with a
  </i>plano concave<i>, without any kind of reflection, divers also by
  means of </i>reflection<i>. I have made others of </i>Waters<i>,
  </i>Gums<i>, </i>Resins<i>, </i>Salts<i>, </i>Arsenick<i>, </i>Oyls<i>,
  and with divers other </i>mixtures of watery<i> and </i>oyly Liquors<i>.
  And indeed the subject is capable of a great variety; but I find
  generally none more useful then that which is made with </i>two
  Glasses<i>, such as I have already describ'd.</i></p>

  <p><i>What the things are I observ'd, the following descriptions will
  manifest; in brief, they were either </i>exceeding small Bodies<i>, or
  </i>exceeding small Pores<i>, or </i>exceeding small Motions<i>, some of
  each of which the Reader will find in the following Notes, and such, as I
  presume, (many of them at least) will be </i>new<i>, and perhaps not less
  </i>strange<i>: Some </i>specimen<i> of each of which Heads the Reader
  will find in the subsequent delineations, and indeed of some more then I
  was willing there should be; which was occasioned by my first Intentions
  to print a much greater number then I have since found time to compleat.
  Of such therefore as I had, I selected only some few of every Head, which
  for some particulars seem'd most observable, rejecting the rest as
  superfluous to the present Design.</i></p>

  <p><i>What each of the delineated Subjects are, the following
  descriptions annext to each will inform, of which I shall here, only once
  for all, add, That in divers of them the Gravers have pretty well
  follow'd my directions and draughts; and that in making of them, I
  indeavoured (as far as I was able) first to discover the true appearance,
  and next to make a plain representation of it. This I mention the rather,
  because of these kind of Objects there is much more difficulty to
  discover the true shape, then of those visible to the naked eye, the same
  Object seeming quite differing, in one position to the Light, from what
  it really is, and may be discover'd in another. And therefore I never
  began to make any draught before by many examinations in several lights,
  and in several positions to those lights, I had discover'd the true form.
  For it is exceeding difficult in some Objects, to distinguish between a
  </i>prominency<i> and a </i>depression<i>, between a </i>shadow<i> and a
  </i>black stain<i>, or a </i>reflection<i> and a </i>whiteness in the
  colour<i>. Besides, the transparency of most Objects renders them yet
  much more difficult then if they were </i>opacous<i>. The Eyes of a Fly
  in one kind of light appear almost like a Lattice, drill'd through with
  abundance of small holes; which probably may be the Reason, why the
  Ingenious </i>Dr. Power<i> seems to suppose them such. In the Sunshine
  they look like a Surface cover'd with golden Nails; in another posture,
  like a Surface cover'd with Pyramids; in another with Cones; and in other
  postures of quite other shapes; but that which exhibits the best, is the
  Light collected on the Object, by those means I have already
  describ'd.</i></p>

  <p><i>And this was undertaken in prosecution of the Design which the
  </i>ROYAL SOCIETY<i> has propos'd to it self. For the Members of the
  Assembly having before their eys so many </i>fatal<i> Instances of the
  errors and falshoods, in which the greatest part of mankind has so long
  wandred, because they rely'd upon the strength of humane Reason alone,
  have begun anew to correct all </i>Hypotheses<i> by sense, as Seamen do
  their </i>dead Reckonings<i> by </i>C&#339;lestial Observations<i>; and
  to this purpose it has been their principal indeavour to </i>enlarge
  &amp; strengthen<i> the </i>Senses<i> by </i>Medicine<i>, and by such
  </i>outward Instruments<i> as are proper for their particular works. By
  this means they find some reason to suspect, that those effects of
  Bodies, which have been commonly attributed to </i>Qualities<i>, and
  those confess'd to be </i>occult<i>, are perform'd by the small
  </i>Machines<i> of Nature, which are not to be discern'd without these
  helps, seeming the meer products of </i>Motion<i>, </i>Figure<i>, and
  </i>Magnitude<i>; and that the </i>Natural Textures<i>, which some call
  the </i>Plastick faculty<i>, may be made in </i>Looms<i>, which a greater
  perfection of Opticks may make discernable by these Glasses; so as now
  they are no more puzzled about them, then the vulgar are to conceive, how
  </i>Tapestry<i> or </i>flowred Stuffs<i> are woven. And the ends of all
  these Inquiries they intend to be the </i>Pleasure<i> of Contemplative
  minds, but above all, the </i>ease and dispatch<i> of the labours of mens
  hands. They do indeed neglect no opportunity to bring all the </i>rare<i>
  things of Remote Countries within the compass of their knowledge and
  practice. But they still acknowledg their </i>most useful<i> Informations
  to arise from </i>common<i> things, and from </i>diversifying<i> their
  most </i>ordinary<i> operations upon them. They do not wholly reject
  Experiments of meer </i>light<i> and </i>theory<i>; but they principally
  aim at such, whose Applications will </i>improve and facilitate<i> the
  present way of </i>Manual Arts<i>. And though some men, who are perhaps
  taken up about less honourable Employments, are pleas'd to censure their
  proceedings, yet they can shew more </i>fruits<i> of their first three
  years, wherein they have assembled, then any other </i>Society<i> in
  </i>Europe<i> can for a much larger space of time. 'Tis true, such
  undertakings as theirs do commonly meet with small incouragement, because
  men are generally rather taken with the </i>plausible<i> and
  </i>discursive<i>, then the </i>real<i> and the solid part of Philosophy;
  yet by the good fortune of their institution, in an Age of all others the
  most </i>inquisitive<i>, they have been assisted by the
  </i>contribution<i> and </i>presence<i> of very many of the chief
  </i>Nobility<i> and </i>Gentry<i>, and others who are some of the
  </i>most considerable<i> in their several Professions. But that that yet
  farther convinces me of the </i>Real esteem<i> that the more
  </i>serious<i> part of men have of this </i>Society<i>, is, that several
  </i>Merchants<i>, men who act in earnest (whose Object is </i>meum &amp;
  tuum<i>, that great </i>Rudder<i> of humane affairs) have adventur'd
  considerable sums of </i>Money<i>, to put in practice what some of our
  Members have contrived, and have continued </i>stedfast<i> in their good
  opinions of such Indeavours, when not one of a hundred of the vulgar have
  believed their undertakings feasable. And it it also fit to be added,
  that they have one advantage peculiar to themselves, that very many of
  their number are </i>men of Converse and Traffick<i>; which is a good
  Omen, that their attempts will bring Philosophy from </i>words<i> to
  </i>action<i>, seeing the men of Business have had so great a share in
  their first foundation.</i></p>

  <p><i>And of this kind I ought not to conceal one particular
  </i>Generosity<i>, which more nearly concerns my self. It is the
  </i>munificence<i> of </i>Sir John Cutler<i>, in endowing a Lecture for
  the promotion of </i>Mechanick Arts<i>, to be governed and directed by
  This </i>Society.<i>This </i>Bounty<i> I mention for the
  </i>Honourableness<i> of the thing it self, and for the expectation which
  I have of the </i>efficacy<i> of the </i>Example<i>; for it cannot now be
  objected to them, that their Designs will be esteemed </i>frivolous<i>
  and </i>vain<i>, when they have such a </i>real Testimony<i> of the
  </i>Approbation<i> of a </i>Man<i> that is such an </i>eminent
  Ornament<i> of this renowned City, and one, who, by the </i>Variety<i>,
  and the </i>happy Success<i>, of his negotiations, has given evident
  proofs, that he is not easie to be deceiv'd. This Gentleman has well
  observ'd, that the </i>Arts<i> of life have been too long
  </i>imprison'd<i> in the dark shops of Mechanicks themselves, &amp; there
  </i>hindred from growth<i>, either by ignorance, or self-interest: and he
  has bravely </i>freed<i> them from these </i>inconveniences<i>: He hath
  not only obliged </i>Tradesmen<i>, but </i>Trade<i> it self: He has done
  a work that is worthy of </i>London<i>, and has taught the chief City of
  Commerce in the world the right way how Commerce is to be improv'd. We
  have already seen many other great signs of Liberality and a large mind,
  from the same hand: For by his </i>diligence<i> about the </i>Corporation
  for the Poor<i>; by his honorable </i>Subscriptions<i> for the rebuilding
  of St. Paul's; by his chearful </i>Disbursment<i> for the replanting of
  </i>Ireland<i>, and by many other such </i>publick works<i>, he has shewn
  by what means he indeavours to </i>establish<i> his Memory; and now by
  this last gift he has done that, which became one of the </i>wisest
  Citizens<i> of our Nation to accomplish, seeing one of the </i>wisest of
  our Statesmen, the Lord Verulam<i>, first propounded it.</i></p>

  <p><i>But to return to my Subject, from a digression, which, I hope, my
  Reader will pardon me, seeing the Example is so rare that I can make no
  more such digressions. If these my first Labours shall be any wayes
  useful to inquiring men, I must attribute the incouragement and promotion
  of them to a very </i>Reverend<i> and </i>Learned Person<i>, of whom this
  ought in justice to be said, </i>That there is scarce any one Invention,
  which this Nation has produc'd in our Age, but it has some way or other
  been set forward by his assistance<i>. My Reader, I believe, will quickly
  ghess, that it is </i>Dr. Wilkins<i> that I mean. He is indeed a man born
  for the </i>good<i> of </i>mankind<i>, and for the </i>honour<i> of his
  </i>Country<i>. In the </i>sweetness<i> of whose </i>behaviour<i>, in the
  </i>calmness<i> of his </i>mind<i>, in the </i>unbounded goodness<i> of
  his </i>heart<i>, we have an evident Instance, what the true and the
  </i>primitive unpassionate Religion<i> was, before it was </i>sowred<i>
  by particular </i>Factions.<i> In a word, his </i>Zeal<i> has been so
  </i>constant<i> and </i>effectual<i> in advancing all good and profitable
  </i>Arts, that<i> as one of the Antient </i>Romans<i> said of
  </i>Scipio<i>, </i>That he thanked God that he was a <i>Roman</i>;
  because whereever <i>Scipio</i> had been born, there had been the seat of
  the Empire of the world<i>: So may I thank God, that </i>Dr. Wilkins<i>
  was an </i>Englishman<i>, for whereever he had lived, there had been the
  chief Seat of </i>generous Knowledge<i> and </i>true Philosophy<i>. To
  the truth of this, there are so many worthy men living that will
  subscribe, that I am confident, what I have here said, will not be looked
  upon, by any ingenious Reader, as a </i>Panegyrick<i>, but only as a
  </i>real testimony<i>.</i></p>

  <p><i>By the Advice of this </i>Excellent man<i> I first set upon this
  Enterprise, yet still came to it with much </i>Reluctancy<i>, because I
  was to follow the footsteps of so eminent a Person as </i>Dr. Wren<i>,
  who was the first that attempted any thing of this nature; whose original
  draughts do now make one of the Ornaments of that great Collection of
  Rarities in the </i>Kings Closet<i>. This </i>Honor<i>, which his first
  beginnings of this kind have receiv'd, to be admitted into the most
  famous place of the world, did not so much </i>incourage<i>, as the
  </i>hazard<i> of coming after </i>Dr. Wren<i> did </i>affright<i> me; for
  of him I must, affirm, that, since the time of </i>Archimedes<i>, there
  scarce ever met in one man, in so great a perfection, such a
  </i>Mechanical Hand<i>, and so </i>Philosophical<i> a
  </i>Mind<i>.</i></p>

  <p><i>But at last, being assured both by </i>Dr. Wilkins<i>, and </i>Dr.
  Wren<i> himself, that he had given over his intentions of prosecuting it,
  and not finding that there was any else design'd the pursuing of it, I
  set upon this undertaking, and was not a little incourag'd to proceed in
  it, by the Honour the </i>Royal Society<i> was pleas'd to favour me with,
  in approving of those draughts (which from time to time as I had an
  opportunity of describing) I presented to them. And particularly by the
  Incitements of divers of those Noble and excellent Persons of it, which
  were my more especial Friends, who were not less urgent with me for the
  publishing, then for the prosecution of them.</i></p>

  <p><i>After I had almost compleated these Pictures and Observations
  (having had divers of them ingraven, and was ready to send them to the
  Press) I was inform'd, that the Ingenious Physitian </i>Dr. Henry
  Power<i> had made several </i>Microscopical<i> Observations, which had I
  not afterwards, upon our interchangably viewing each others Papers, found
  that they were for the most part differing from mine, either in the
  Subject it self, or in the particulars taken notice of; and that his
  design was only to print Observations without Pictures, I had even then
  </i>suppressed<i> what I had so far proceeded in. But being further
  </i>excited<i> by several of my Friends, in complyance with their
  opinions, that it would not be unacceptable to several inquisitive Men,
  and hoping also, that I should thereby discover something New to the
  World, I have at length cast in my Mite, into the vast Treasury of </i>A
  Philosophical History<i>. And it is my </i>hope<i>, as well as
  </i>belief<i>, that these my </i>Labours<i> will be no more comparable to
  the </i>Productions<i> of many other </i>Natural Philosophers<i>, who are
  now every where busie about </i>greater<i> things; then my </i>little
  Objects<i> are to be compar'd to the greater and more beautiful </i>Works
  of Nature<i>, A Flea, a Mite, a Gnat, to an Horse, an Elephant, or a
  Lyon.</i></p>

  </span>
  in <i>Geometry</i>, the most natural way of beginning is from a
  Mathematical <i>point</i>; so is the same method in Observations and
  <i>Natural history</i> the most genuine, simple, and instructive. We must
  first endevour to make <i>letters</i>, and draw <i>single</i> strokes
  true, before we venture to write whole <i>Sentences</i>, or to draw large
  <i>Pictures</i>. And in <i>Physical</i> Enquiries, we must endevour to
  follow Nature in the more <i>plain</i> and <i>easie</i> ways she treads
  in the most <i>simple</i> and <i>uncompounded bodies</i>, to trace her
  steps, and be acquainted with her manner of walking there, before we
  venture our selves into the multitude of <i>meanders</i> she has in
  <i>bodies of a more complicated</i> nature; lest, being unable to
  distinguish and judge of our way, we quickly lose both <i>Nature</i> our
  Guide, and <i>our selves</i> too, and are left to wander in the
  <i>labyrinth</i> of groundless opinions; wanting both <i>judgment</i>,
  that <i>light</i>, and <i>experience</i>, that <i>clew</i>, which should
  direct our proceedings.</p>

  <p>We will begin these our Inquiries therefore with the Observations of
  Bodies of the most <i>simple nature</i> first, and so gradually proceed
  to those of a more <i>compounded</i> one. In prosecution of which method,
  we shall begin with a <i>Physical point</i>; of which kind the <i>Point
  of a Needle</i> is commonly reckon'd for one; and is indeed, for the most
  part, made so sharp, that the naked eye cannot distinguish any parts of
  it: It very easily pierces, and makes its way through all kind of bodies
  softer then it self: But if view'd with a very good <i>Microscope</i>, we
  may find that the <i>top</i> of a Needle (though as to the sense
  very <i>sharp</i>) appears a <i>broad</i>, <i>blunt,</i> and very
  <i>irregular</i> end; not resembling a Cone, as is imagin'd, but onely a
  piece of a tapering body, with a great part of the top remov'd, or
  deficient. The Points of Pins are yet more blunt, and the Points of the
  most curious Mathematical Instruments do very seldome arrive at so great
  a sharpness; how much therefore can be built upon demonstrations made
  onely by the productions of the Ruler and Compasses, he will be better
  able to consider that shall but view those <i>points</i> and <i>lines</i>
  with a <i>Microscope</i>.</p>

  <p>Now though this point be commonly accounted the sharpest (whence when
  we would express the sharpness of a point the most <i>superlatively</i>,
  we say, As sharp as a Needle) yet the <i>Microscope</i> can afford us
  hundreds of Instances of Points many thousand times sharper: such as
  those of the <i>hairs</i>, and <i>bristles</i>, and <i>claws</i> of
  multitudes of <i>Insects</i>; the <i>thorns</i>, or <i>crooks</i>, or
  <i>hairs</i> of <i>leaves</i>, and other small vegetables; nay, the ends
  of the <i>stiriæ</i> or small <i>parallelipipeds</i> of <i>Amianthus</i>,
  and <i>alumen plumosum</i>; of many of which, though the Points are so
  sharp as not to be visible, though view'd with a <i>Microscope</i> (which
  magnifies the Object, in bulk, above a million of times) yet I doubt not,
  but were we able <i>practically</i> to make <i>Microscopes</i> according
  to the <i>theory</i> of them, we might find hills, and dales, and pores,
  and a sufficient bredth, or expansion, to give all those parts
  elbow-room, even in the blunt top of the very Point of any of these so
  very sharp bodies. For certainly the <i>quantity</i> or extension of any
  body may be <i>Divisible in infinitum</i>, though perhaps not the
  <i>matter</i>.</p>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-02.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 2.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 1.
</span>
  <p>But to proceed: The Image we have here exhibited in the first Figure, was the top of a
  small and very sharp Needle, whose point <i>aa</i> nevertheless appear'd
  through the <i>Microscope</i> above a quarter of an inch broad, not round
  nor flat, but <i>irregular</i> and <i>uneven</i>; so that it seem'd to
  have been big enough to have afforded a hundred armed Mites room enough
  to be rang'd by each other without endangering the breaking one anothers
  necks, by being thrust off on either side. The surface of which, though
  appearing to the naked eye very smooth, could not nevertheless hide a
  multitude of holes and scratches and ruggednesses from being discover'd
  by the <i>Microscope</i> to invest it, several of which inequalities (as
  A, B, C, seem'd <i>holes</i> made by some small specks of <i>Rust</i>;
  and D some <i>adventitious body</i>, that stuck very close to it) were
  <i>casual</i>. All the rest that roughen the surface, were onely so many
  marks of the rudeness and bungling of <i>Art</i>. So unaccurate is it, in
  all its productions, even in those which seem most neat, that if examin'd
  with an organ more acute then that by which they were made, the more we
  see of their <i>shape</i>, the less appearance will there be of their
  <i>beauty</i>: whereas in the works of <i>Nature</i>, the deepest
  Discoveries shew us the greatest Excellencies. An evident Argument, that
  he that was the Author of all these things, was no other then
  <i>Omnipotent</i>; being able to include as great a variety of parts and
  contrivances in the yet smallest Discernable Point, as in those vaster
  bodies (which comparatively are called also Points) such as the
  <i>Earth</i>, <i>Sun</i>, or <i>Planets</i>. Nor need it seem strange
  that the Earth it self may be by <i>Analogie</i> call'd a Physical Point:
  For as its body, though now so near us as to fill our eys and
  fancies with a sense of the vastness of it, may by a little Distance, and
  some convenient <i>Diminishing</i> Glasses, be made vanish into a scarce
  visible Speck, or Point (as I have often try'd on the <i>Moon</i>, and
  (when not too bright) on the <i>Sun</i> it self.) So, could a Mechanical
  contrivance succesfully answer our <i>Theory</i>, we might see the least
  spot as big as the Earth it self; and Discover, as <i>Des Cartes</i>
  also conjectures (<i>Diop.</i> ch. 10. § 9.),
  as great a variety of bodies in the <i>Moon</i>, or <i>Planets</i>, as in
  the <i>Earth</i>.</p>

  <p>But leaving these Discoveries to future Industries, we shall proceed
  to add one Observation more of a <i>point</i> commonly so call'd, that
  is, the mark of a <i>full stop</i>, or <i>period</i>. And for this
  purpose I observed many both <i>printed</i> ones and <i>written</i>; and
  among multitudes I found <i>few</i> of them more <i>round</i> or
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-02.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 2.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 3.
</span>
  <i>regular</i> then this which I have delineated in the third figure of
  the second Scheme, but <i>very many</i> abundantly <i>more
  disfigur'd</i>; and for the most part if they seem'd equally round to the
  eye, I found those points that had been made by a <i>Copper-plate,</i>
  and Roll-press, to be as misshapen as those which had been made with
  <i>Types</i>, the most curious and smothly <i>engraven strokes</i> and
  <i>points</i>, looking but as so many <i>furrows</i> and <i>holes</i>,
  and their <i>printed impressions</i>, but like <i>smutty daubings</i> on
  a matt or uneven floor with a blunt extinguisht brand or stick's end. And
  as for <i>points</i> made with a <i>pen</i> they were much <i>more
  ragged</i> and <i>deformed</i>. Nay, having view'd certain pieces of
  exceeding curious writing of the kind (one of which in the bredth of a
  <i>two-pence</i> compris'd <i>the Lords prayer, the Apostles Creed, the
  ten Commandments, and about half a dozen verses besides of the Bible</i>,
  whose <i>lines</i> were <i>so small</i> and <i>near together</i>, that I
  was unable to <i>number</i> them with my <i>naked eye</i>,) a very
  ordinary <i>Microscope</i>, I had then about me, inabled me to see that
  what the Writer of it had asserted was <i>true</i>, but withall
  discover'd of what pitifull <i>bungling scribbles</i> and <i>scrawls</i>
  it was compos'd, <i>Arabian</i> and <i>China characters</i> being almost
  as well shap'd, yet thus much I must say for the Man, that it was for the
  most part <i>legible</i> enough, though in some places there wanted a
  good <i>fantsy</i> well <i>preposest</i> to help one through. If this
  manner <i>of small writing</i> were made <i>easie</i> and
  <i>practicable</i> (and I think I know such a one, but have never yet
  made tryal of it, whereby one might be inabled to write <i>a great
  deale</i> with <i>much ease</i>, and <i>accurately</i> enough in a very
  <i>little roome</i>) it might be of very good use to convey <i>secret
  Intelligence</i> without any danger of <i>Discovery</i> or
  <i>mistrusting</i>. But to come again to the point. The
  <i>Irregularities</i> of it are caused by three or four
  <i>coadjutors</i>, one of which is, the <i>uneven surface</i> of the
  <i>paper</i>, which at best appears no smother then a very course piece
  of <i>shag'd cloth</i>, next the <i>irregularity of the Type</i> or
  <i>Ingraving</i>, and a third is the <i>rough Daubing</i> of the
  <i>Printing-Ink</i> that lies upon the instrument that makes the
  impression, to all which, add the <i>variation</i> made by the Different
  <i>lights</i> and <i>shadows</i>, and you may have sufficient reason to
  guess that a <i>point</i> may appear much more <i>ugly</i> then
  <i>this</i>, which I have here presented, which though it appear'd
  through the <i>Microscope</i> <i>gray</i>, like a great splatch of
  <i>London</i> dirt, about three inches over; yet to the <i>naked eye</i>
  it was <i>black</i> and no bigger then that in the midst of the Circle A.
  And could I have found Room in this Plate to have inserted an O
  you should have seen that the <i>letters</i> were not more distinct then
  the <i>points</i> of Distinction, nor a <i>drawn circle</i> more exactly
  <i>so</i>, then we have now shown a <i>point</i> to be a
  <i>point</i>.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsII" id="obsII">II</a>. <i>Of the Edge of a Razor.</i></h3>

  <p>The sharpest <i>Edge</i> hath the same kind of affinity to the
  sharpest <i>Point</i> in Physicks, as a <i>line</i> hath to a
  <i>point</i> in Mathematicks; and therefore the Treaty concerning this,
  may very properly be annexed to the former. A Razor doth appear to be a
  Body of a very neat and curious aspect, till more closely viewed by the
  <i>Microscope</i>, and there we may observe its very Edge to be of all
  kind of shapes, except what it should be. For examining that of a very
  sharp one, I could not find that any part of it had any thing of
  sharpness in it; but it appeared a rough surface of a very considerable
  bredth from side to side, the narrowest part not seeming thinner then the
  back of a pretty thick Knife. Nor is't likely that it should appear any
  otherwise, since as we just now shew'd that a <i>point</i> appear'd a
  <i>circle</i>, 'tis rational a <i>line</i> should be a
  <i>parallelogram</i>.</p>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-02.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 2.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 2.
</span>
  <p>Now for the drawing this second Figure
  (which represents a part of the Edge
  about half a quarter of an inch long of a Razor well set) I so plac'd it
  between the Object-glass &amp; the light, that there appear'd a
  reflection from the very Edge, represented by the white line
  <i>abcdef</i>. In which you may perceive it to be somewhat sharper then
  elsewhere about <i>d</i>, to be indented or pitted about <i>b</i>, to be
  broader and thicker about <i>c</i>, and unequal and rugged about
  <i>e</i>, and pretty even between <i>ab</i> and <i>ef</i>. Nor was that
  part of the Edge <i>ghik</i> so smooth as one would imagine so smooth
  bodies as a Hone and Oyl should leave it; for besides those multitudes of
  scratches, which appear to have raz'd the surface <i>ghik</i>, and to
  cross each other every way which are not half of them exprest in the
  Figure, there were several great and deep scratches, or furrows, such as
  <i>gh</i> and <i>ik</i>, which made the surface yet more rugged, caus'd
  perhaps by some small Dust casually falling on the Hone, or some harder
  or more flinty part of the Hone it self. The other part of the Razor
  <i>ll</i>, which is polish'd on a grinding-stone, appear'd much rougher
  then the other, looking almost like a plow'd field, with many parallels,
  ridges, and furrows, and a cloddy, as 'twere, or an uneven surface: nor
  shall we wonder at the roughnesses of those surfaces, since even in the
  most curious wrought Glasses for <i>Microscopes</i>, and other Optical
  uses, I have, when the Sun has shone well on them, discover'd their
  surface to be variously raz'd or scratched, and to consist of an infinite
  of small broken surfaces, which reflect the light of very various and
  differing colours. And indeed it seems impossible by Art to cut the
  surface of any hard and brittle body smooth, since <i>Putte</i>, or even
  the most curious <i>Powder</i> that can be made use of, to polish such a
  body, must consist of little hard rough particles, and each of them must
  cut its way, and consequently leave some kind of gutter or furrow
  behind it. And though Nature does seem to do it very readily in all kinds
  of fluid bodies, yet perhaps future observators may discover even these
  also rugged; it being very probable, as I elsewhere shew, that fluid
  bodies are made up of small solid particles variously and strongly mov'd,
  and may find reason to think there is scarce a surface <i>in rerum
  naturâ</i> perfectly smooth. The black spot <i>mn</i>, I ghess to be some
  small speck of rust, for that I have oft observ'd to be the manner of the
  working of Corrosive Juyces. To conclude, this Edge and piece of a Razor,
  if it had been really such as it appear'd through the <i>Microscope</i>,
  would scarcely have serv'd to cleave wood, much less to have cut off the
  hair of beards, unless it were after the manner that <i>Lucian</i>
  merrily relates <i>Charon</i> to have made use of, when with a Carpenters
  Axe he chop'd off the beard of a sage Philosopher, whose gravity he very
  cautiously fear'd would indanger the oversetting of his Wherry.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsIII" id="obsIII">III</a>. <i>Of fine Lawn, or Linnen Cloth.</i></h3>

  <p>This is another product of Art, A piece of the finest Lawn I was able
  to get, so curious that the threads were scarce discernable by the naked
  eye, and yet through an ordinary <i>Microscope</i> you may perceive what a goodly
  piece of <i>coarse Matting</i> it is; what proportionable cords each of
  its threads are, being not unlike, both in shape and size, the bigger and
  coarser kind of <i>single Rope-yarn</i>, wherewith they usually make
  <i>Cables</i>. That which makes the Lawn so transparent, is by the
  <i>Microscope</i>, nay by the naked eye, if attentively viewed, plainly
  enough evidenced to be the multitude of square holes which are left
  between the threads, appearing to have much more hole in respect of the
  intercurrent parts then is for the most part left in a
  <i>lattice-window</i>, which it does a little resemble, onely the
  crossing parts are round and not flat.</p>

  <p>These threads that compose this fine contexture, though they are as
  small as those that constitute the finer sorts of Silks, have
  notwithstanding nothing of their glossie, pleasant, and lively
  reflection. Nay, I have been informed both by the Inventor himself, and
  several other eye-witnesses, that though the flax, out of which it is
  made, has been (by a singular art, of that excellent Person, and Noble
  Vertuoso, M. <i>Charls Howard</i>, brother to the <i>Duke of Norfolk</i>)
  so curiously dress'd and prepar'd, as to appear both to the eye and the
  touch, full as <i>fine</i> and as <i>glossie</i>, and to receive all
  kinds of colours, as well as Sleave-Silk; yet when this Silken Flax is
  twisted into threads, it quite loseth its former luster, and becomes as
  plain and base a thread to look on, as one of the same bigness, made of
  common Flax.</p>

  <p>The reason of which odd <i>Phenomenon</i> seems no other then this;
  that though the curiously drest Flax has its parts so exceedingly small,
  as to equallize, if not to be much smaller then the clew of the
  Silk-worm, especially in thinness, yet the differences between the
  figures of the constituting filaments are so great, and their substances
  so various, that whereas those of the <i>Silk</i> are
  <i>small</i>, <i>round</i>, <i>hard</i>, <i>transparent,</i> and to their
  bigness proportionably <i>stiff</i>, so as each filament preserves its
  proper <i>Figure</i>, and consequently its vivid <i>reflection</i>
  intire, though twisted into a thread, if not too hard; those of Flax are
  <i>flat</i>, <i>limber</i>, <i>softer,</i> and <i>less transparent</i>,
  and in twisting into a thread they joyn, and lie so close together, as to
  lose their own, and destroy each others particular reflections. There
  seems therefore three Particulars very requisite to make the so drest
  Flax appear Silk also when spun into threads. First, that the substance
  of it should be made more <i>clear</i> and <i>transparent</i>, Flax
  retaining in it a kind of opacating brown, or yellow; and the parts of
  the whitest kind I have yet observ'd with the <i>Microscope</i> appearing
  white, like flaw'd Horn or Glass, rather then clear, like clear Horn or
  Glass. Next that, the filaments should each of them be <i>rounded</i>, if
  that could be done, which yet is not so very necessary, if the first be
  perform'd, and this third, which is, that each of the small filaments be
  <i>stifned</i>; for though they be square, or flat, provided they be
  <i>transparent</i> and stiff, much the same appearances must necessarily
  follow. Now, though I have not yet made trial, yet I doubt not, but that
  both these proprieties may be also induc'd upon the Flax, and perhaps too
  by one and the same Expedient, which some trials may quickly inform any
  ingenious attempter of, who from the use and profit of such an Invention,
  may find sufficient argument to be prompted to such Inquiries. As for the
  <i>tenacity</i> of the substance of Flax, out of which the thread is
  made, it seems much inferiour to that of Silk, the one being a
  <i>vegetable</i>, the other an <i>animal</i> substance. And whether it
  proceed from the better concoction, or the more homogeneous constitution
  of <i>animal</i> substances above those of <i>vegetables</i>, I do not
  here determine; yet since I generally find, that <i>vegetable</i>
  substances do not equalize the <i>tenacity</i> of <i>animal</i>, nor
  these the <i>tenacity</i> of some purified <i>mineral</i> substances; I
  am very apt to think, that the <i>tenacity</i> of bodies does not proceed
  from the <i>hamous</i>, or <i>hooked</i> particles, as the
  <i>Epicureans</i> and some modern <i>Philosophers</i> have imagin'd; but
  from the more exact <i>congruity</i> of the constituent parts, which are
  contiguous to each other, and so bulky, as not to be easily separated, or
  shatter'd, by any small pulls or concussion of heat.</p>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-03.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 3.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 1.
</span>
  <p>This is the
  appearance of a piece of very fine Taffety-riband in the bigger
  magnifying Glass, which you see exhibits it like a very convenient
  substance to make Bed-matts, or Door-matts of, or to serve for Beehives,
  Corn-scuttles, Chairs, or Corn-tubs, it being not unlike that kind of
  work, wherewith in many parts in <i>England</i>, they make such Utensils
  of Straw, a little wreathed, and bound together with thongs of Brambles.
  For in this Contexture, each little filament, fiber, or clew of the
  Silk-worm, seem'd about the bigness of an ordinary Straw, as appears by
  the little irregular pieces, <i>ab</i>, <i>cd</i>, and <i>ef</i>;
  The <i>Warp</i>, or the thread that ran crossing the Riband, appear'd
  like a single Rope of an Inch Diameter; but the <i>Woof</i>, or the
  thread that ran the length of the Riband, appear'd not half so big. Each
  Inch of six-peny-broad Riband appearing no less then a piece of Matting
  Inch and half thick, and twelve foot square, a few yards of this, would
  be enough to floor the long Gallery of the <i>Loure</i> at <i>Paris</i>.
  But to return to our piece of Riband: It affords us a not unpleasant
  object, appearing like a bundle, or wreath, of very clear and transparent
  <i>Cylinders</i>, if the Silk be white, and curiously ting'd; if it be
  colour'd, each of those small horney <i>Cylinders</i> affording in some
  place or other of them, as vivid a reflection, as if it had been sent
  from a <i>Cylinder</i> of Glass or Horn. In-so-much, that the reflexions
  of Red, appear'd as if coming from so many <i>Granates</i>, or
  <i>Rubies</i>. The loveliness of the colours of Silks above those of
  hairy Stuffs, or Linnen, consisting, as I else-where intimate, chiefly in
  the transparency, and vivid reflections from the <i>Concave</i>, or inner
  surface of the <i>transparent Cylinder</i>, as are also the colours of
  Precious Stones; for most of the reflections from each of these
  <i>Cylinders</i>, come from the <i>Concave</i> surface of the air, which
  is as 'twere the foil that incompasses the <i>Cylinder</i>. The colours
  with which each of these <i>Cylinders</i> are ting'd, seem partly to be
  superficial, and sticking to the out-sides of them; and partly, to be
  imbib'd, or sunck into the substance of them: for Silk, seeming to be
  little else then a dried thread of Glew, may be suppos'd to be very
  easily relaxt, and softened, by being steeped in warm, nay in cold, if
  penetrant, juyces or liquors. And thereby those tinctures, though they
  tinge perhaps but a small part of the substance, yet being so highly
  impregnated with the colour, as to be almost black with it, may leave an
  impression strong enough to exhibite the desir'd colour. A pretty kinde
  of artificial Stuff I have seen, looking almost like transparent
  Parchment, Horn, or Ising-glass, and perhaps some such thing it may be
  made of, which being transparent, and of a glutinous nature, and easily
  mollified by keeping in water, as I found upon trial, had imbib'd, and
  did remain ting'd with a great variety of very vivid colours, and to the
  naked eye, it look'd very like the substance of the Silk. And I have
  often thought, that probably there might be a way found out, to make an
  artificial glutinous composition, much resembling, if not full as good,
  nay better, then that Excrement, or whatever other substance it be out of
  which, the Silk-worm wire-draws his clew. If such a composition were
  found, it were certainly an easie matter to find very quick ways of
  drawing it out into small wires for use. I need not mention the use of
  such an Invention, nor the benefit that is likely to accrue to the
  finder, they being sufficiently obvious. This hint therefore, may, I
  hope, give some Ingenious inquisitive Person an occasion of making some
  trials, which if successfull, I have my aim, and I suppose he will have
  no occasion to be displeas'd.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsV" id="obsV">V</a>. <i>Of watered Silks, or Stuffs.</i></h3>

  <p>There are but few <i>Artificial</i> things that are worth observing
  with a <i>Microscope</i>, and therefore I shall speak but briefly
  concerning them. For the Productions of art are such rude mis-shapen
  things, that when view'd with a <i>Microscope</i>, is little else
  observable, but their deformity. The most curious Carvings appearing no
  better then those rude <i>Russian</i> Images we find mention'd in
  <i>Purchas</i>, where three notches at the end of a Stick, stood for a
  face. And the most smooth and burnish'd surfaces appear most rough and
  unpolisht: So that my first Reason why I shall add but a few observations
  of them, is, their mis-shapen form; and the next, is their uselessness.
  For why should we trouble our selves in the examination of that form or
  shape (which is all we are able to reach with a <i>Microscope</i>) which
  we know was design'd for no higher a use, then what we were able to view
  with our naked eye? Why should we endeavour to discover mysteries in that
  which has no such thing in it? And like <i>Rabbins</i> find out
  <i>Caballisms</i>, and <i>ænigmâs</i> in the Figure, and placing of
  Letters, where no such thing lies hid: whereas in <i>natural</i> forms
  there are some so small, and so curious, and their design'd business so
  far remov'd beyond the reach of our sight, that the more we magnify the
  object, the more excellencies and mysteries do appear; And the more we
  discover the imperfections of our senses; and the Omnipotency and
  Infinite perfections of the great Creatour. I shall therefore onely add
  one or two Observations more <i>artificial</i> things, and then come to
  the Treaty concerning such matters as are the Productions of a more
  curious Workman. One of these, shall be that of a piece of water'd Silk,

</span>
  represented in the second Figure of the third <i>Scheme</i>,
  as it appear'd through the
  least magnifying Glass. <i>AB</i> signifying the long way of the Stuff,
  and <i>CD</i> the broad way. This Stuff, if the right side of it be
  looked upon, appears to the naked eye, all over so waved, undulated, or
  grain'd, with a curious, though irregular variety of brighter and darker
  parts, that it adds no small gracefulness to the Gloss of it. It is so
  known a propriety, that it needs but little explication, but it is
  observable, which perhaps everyone has not considered, that those parts
  which appear the darker part of the wave, in one position to the light,
  in another appears the lighter, and the contrary; and by this means the
  undulations become transient, and in a continual change, according as the
  position of the parts in respect of the incident beams of light is
  varied. The reason of which odd <i>phænomena</i>, to one that has but
  diligently examin'd it even with his naked eye, will be obvious enough.
  But he that observes it with a <i>Microscope</i>, may more easily
  perceive what this <i>Proteus</i> is, and how it comes to change its
  shape. He may very easily perceive, that it proceeds onely from the
  variety of the <i>Reflections</i> of light, which is caus'd by the
  various <i>shape of the Particles</i>, or little protuberant parts of the
  thread that compose the surface; and that those parts of the waves that
  appear the brighter, throw towards the eye a
  multitude of small reflections of light, whereas the darker scarce afford
  any. The reason of which reflection, the <i>Microscope</i> plainly
  discovers, as appears by the Figure. In which you may perceive, that the
  brighter parts of the surface consist of an abundance of large and strong
  reflections, denoted by <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>,
  &amp;c. for the surfaces of those threads that run the <i>long way</i>,
  are by the Mechanical process of watering, <i>creas'd</i> or
  <i>angled</i> in another kind of posture then they were by the weaving:
  for by the weaving they are onely <i>bent round</i> the warping threads;
  but by the watering, they are <i>bent with an angle, or elbow</i>, that
  is in stead of lying, or being bent <i>round</i> the threads, as in the
  third Figure, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, are about
  <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i> (<i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i> representing
  the ends, as 'twere, of the cross threads, they are bent about) they are
  creas'd on the top of those threads, with an <i>angle</i>, as in the
  fourth Figure, and that with all imaginable variety; so that, whereas
  before they reflected the light onely from one point of the round
  surface, as about <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, they now when water'd,
  reflect the beams from more then half the whole surface, as <i>de</i>,
  <i>de</i>, <i>de</i>, and in other postures they return no reflections at
  all from those surfaces. Hence in one posture they compose the brighter
  parts of the waves, in another the darker. And these reflections are also
  varied, according as the particular parts are variously bent. The reason
  of which creasing we shall next examine; and here we must fetch our
  information from the Mechanism or manner of proceeding in this operation;
  which, as I have been inform'd, is no other then this.</p>

  <p>They double all the Stuff that is to be water'd, that is, they crease
  it just through the middle of it, the whole length of the piece, leaving
  the right side of the Stuff inward, and placing the two edges, or
  silvages just upon one another, and, as near as they can, place the wale
  so in the doubling of it, that the wale of the one side may lie very near
  parallel, or even with the wale of the other; for the nearer that posture
  they lie, the greater will the watering appear; and the more obliquely,
  or across to each other they lie, the smaller are the waves. Their way
  for folding it for a great wale is thus: they take a Pin, and begin at
  one side of the piece in any wale, and so moving it towards the other
  side, thereby direct their hands to the opposite ends of the wale, and
  then, as near as they can, place the two opposite ends of the same wale
  together, and so double, or fold the whole piece, repeating this enquiry
  with a Pin at every yard or two's distance through the whole length; then
  they sprinkle it with water, and fold it the longways, placing between
  every fold a piece of Pastboard, by which means all the wrong side of the
  water'd Stuff becomes flat, and with little wales, and the wales on the
  other side become the more protuberant; whence the creasings or angular
  bendings of the wales become the more perspicuous. Having folded it in
  this manner, they place it with an interjacent Pastboard into an hot
  Press, where it is kept very violently prest, till it be dry and stiff;
  by which means, the wales of either contiguous sides leave their own
  impressions upon each other, as is very manifest by the second Figure,
  where 'tis obvious enough, that the wale of the piece <i>ABCD</i> runs
  parallel between the pricked lines <i>ef</i>, <i>ef</i>, <i>ef</i>, and
  as manifest to discern the impressions upon
  these wales, left by those that were prest upon them, which lying not
  exactly parallel with them, but a little athwart them, as is denoted by
  the lines of, <i>oooo</i>, <i>gh</i>, <i>gh</i>, <i>gh</i>, between which
  the other wales did lie parallel; they are so variously, and irregularly
  creas'd that being put into that shape when wet, and kept so till they be
  drie, they so let each others threads, that the Moldings remain almost as
  long as the Stuff lasts.</p>

  <p>Hence it may appear to any one that attentively considers the Figure,
  why the parts of the wale <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>,
  <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, should appear bright; and why the parts <i>b</i>,
  <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, should appear
  shadowed, or dark; why some, as <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>,
  <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>, should appear partly light, and partly dark: the
  varieties of which reflections and shadows are the only cause of the
  appearance of watering in Silks, or any other kind of Stuffs.</p>

  <p>From the variety of reflection, may also be deduc'd the cause why a
  small breez or gale of wind ruffling the surface of a smooth water, makes
  it appear black; as also, on the other side, why the smoothing or
  burnishing the surface of whitened Silver makes it look black; and
  multitudes of other phænomena might hereby be solv'd, which are too many
  to be here insisted on.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsVI" id="obsVI">VI</a>. <i>Of Small Glass Canes.</i></h3>

  <p>That I might be satisfied, whether it were not possible to make an
  <i>Artificial</i> pore as <i>small</i> as any <i>Natural</i> I had yet
  found, I made several attemps with small <i>glass pipes</i>, melted in
  the flame of a Lamp, and then very <i>suddenly</i> drawn out into a great
  length. And, by <i>that means</i>, without much difficulty, I was able to
  draw some almost as small as a <i>Cobweb</i>, which yet, with the
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-04.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 4.</a>
</span>
  <i>Microscope</i>, I could plainly perceive
  to be <i>perforated</i>, both by looking
  on the <i>ends</i> of it, and by looking on it <i>against the light</i>
  which was much the <i>easier way</i> to determine whether it were solid
  or perforated; for, taking a small pipe of glass, and closing one end of
  it, then filling it <i>half full</i> of water, and holding it <i>against
  the light</i>, I could, by this means, very easily find what was the
  <i>differing aspect</i> of a <i>solid</i> and a <i>perforated</i> piece
  of glass; and so easily distingish, without seeing either end, whether
  any <i>Cylinder</i> of glass I look'd on, were a <i>solid stick</i>, or a
  <i>hollow cane</i>. And by this means, I could also presently judge of
  any small <i>filament</i> of glass, whether it were <i>hollow</i> or
  <i>not</i>, which would have been exceeding tedious to examine by looking
  on the end. And many such like ways I was fain to make use of, in the
  examining of divers other particulars related in this Book, which would
  have been no easie task to have determined meerly by the more common way
  of looking on, or viewing the Object. For, if we consider first, the very
  <i>faint light</i> wherewith the object is enlightened, whence many
  particles appear <i>opacous</i>, which when more enlightned, appear very
  <i>transparent</i>, so that I was fain to <i>determine</i> its
  <i>transparency</i> by one glass, and its <i>texture</i> by another.
  Next, the <i>unmanageableness</i> of most <i>Objects</i>, by reason
  of their <i>smalness</i>, 3. The
  <i>difficulty of finding</i> the desired point, and of <i>placing</i> it
  so, as to reflect the <i>light conveniently</i> for the Inquiry. Lastly,
  ones being able to view it but with <i>one eye</i> at once, they will
  appear no small <i>obstructions</i>, nor are they easily <i>remov'd</i>
  without many <i>contrivances</i>. But to proceed, I could not find that
  water, or some <i>deeply ting'd</i> liquors would in small ones rise so
  high as one would expect; and the <i>highest</i> I have found it yet rise
  in any of the pipes I have try'd, was to 21 <i>inches</i> above the level
  of the water in the vessel: for though I found that in the small pipes it
  would <i>nimbly enter</i> at first, and run about 6 or 7 <i>inches</i>
  upwards; yet I found it then to move upwards <i>so slow</i>, that I have
  not yet had the <i>patience</i> to observe it above that height of 21
  <i>inches</i> (and that was in a pretty <i>large Pipe</i>, in comparison
  of those I formerly mentioned; for I could observe the <i>progress</i> of
  a <i>very deep ting'd liquor</i> in it with my <i>naked eye</i>, without
  much trouble; whereas many of the <i>other pipes</i> were so <i>very
  small</i>, that unless in a <i>convenient posture</i> to the light, I
  could not perceive <i>them</i>:) But 'tis very probable, that a greater
  <i>patience</i> and <i>assiduity</i> may discover the liquors to
  <i>rise</i>, at least to remain <i>suspended</i>, at heights that I
  should be loath now even to <i>ghess</i> at, if at least there be any
  <i>proportion</i> kept between the height of the ascending liquor, and
  the <i>bigness of the holes</i> of the pipes.</p>

<p class="center"><b><i>An Attempt for the Explication of this Experiment.</i></b></p>

  <p>My Conjecture, <i>That the unequal height of the surfaces of the
  water, proceeded from the greater pressure made upon the water by the Air
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-04.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 4.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 1.
</span>
  without the Pipes</i> ABC, <i>then by that within them</i>
  I shall endeavour to
  confirm from the truth of the two following <i>Propositions</i>:</p>

  <p>The first of which is, <i>That an unequal pressure of the incumbent
  Air, will cause an unequal height in the water's Surfaces</i>.</p>

  <p>And the second is, <i>That in this experiment there is such an unequal
  pressure</i>.</p>

  <p>That the first is true, the following <i>Experiment</i> will evince.
  For if you take any Vessel so contrived, as that you can at pleasure
  either <i>increase</i> or <i>diminish</i> the <i>pressure</i> of the Air
  upon this or that part of the <i>Superficies</i> of the <i>water</i>, the
  <i>equality</i> of the height of those parts will presently be
  <i>lost</i>; and that part of the <i>Superficies</i> that sustains the
  <i>greater pressure</i>, will be <i>inferior</i> to that which undergoes
  the <i>less</i>. A fit Vessel for this purpose, will be an inverted Glass
  <i>Syphon</i>, such an one as is described in the <i>Sixth Figure</i>.
  For if into it you put Water enough to fill it as high as <i>AB</i>, and
  gently blow in at <i>D</i>, you shall <i>depress</i> the Superficies
  <i>B</i>, and thereby <i>raise</i> the opposite Superficies <i>A</i> to a
  <i>considerable height</i>, and by gently <i>sucking</i> you may produce
  clean <i>contrary</i> effects.</p>

  <p>Next, That there is such an <i>unequal pressure</i>, I shall prove
  from this, <i>That there is a much greater incongruity of Air to Glass,
  and some other Bodies, then there is of Water to the same</i>.</p>

  <p>By <i>Congruity, I mean a property of a fluid Body, whereby any part
  of it is readily united with any other part, either of itself, or of any
  other Similar, fluid, or solid body: And by Incongruity a property of a
  fluid, by which it is hindred from uniting with any dissimilar, fluid, or
  solid Body.</i></p>

  <p>This last property, any one that hath been observingly conversant
  about fluid Bodies, cannot be ignorant of. For (not now to mention
  several <i>Chymical Spirits</i> and <i>Oyls</i>, which will <i>very
  hardly</i>, if at <i>all</i>, be brought to <i>mix</i> with one another;
  insomuch that there may be found some 8 or 9, or more, several distinct
  Liquors, which <i>swimming</i> one upon another, will not presently
  <i>mix</i>) we need seek no further for Examples of this kind in
  <i>fluids</i>, then to observe the <i>drops of rain</i> falling through
  the <i>air</i> and the <i>bubbles of air</i> which are by any means
  conveyed under the surface of the <i>water</i>; or a drop of common
  <i>Sallet Oyl</i> swimming upon water. In all which, and many more
  examples of this kind that might be enumerated, the <i>incongruity</i> of
  two <i>fluids</i> is easily discernable. And as for the <i>Congruity</i>
  or <i>Incongruity</i> of Liquids, with several kinds of <i>firm</i>
  Bodies, they have long since been taken notice of, and called by the
  Names of <i>Driness</i> and <i>Moisture</i> (though these two names are
  not comprehensive enough, being commonly used to signifie only the
  adhering or not adhering of <i>water</i> to some other <i>solid
  Bodies</i>) of this kind we may observe that <i>water</i> will more
  readily <i>wet some woods</i> then <i>others</i>; and that <i>water</i>,
  let fall upon a <i>Feather</i>, the whiter side of a <i>Colwort</i>, and
  some other leaves, or upon almost any <i>dusty</i>, <i>unctuous</i>, or
  <i>resinous</i> superficies, will not <i>at all adhere</i> to them, but
  easily <i>tumble off</i> from them, like a solid <i>Bowl</i>; whereas, if
  dropt upon <i>Linnen</i>, <i>Paper</i>, <i>Clay</i>, <i>green Wood</i>,
  &amp;c. it will not be taken off, without leaving some part of it behind
  <i>adhering</i> to them. So <i>Quick-silver</i>, which will very
  <i>hardly</i> be brought to <i>stick</i> to any <i>vegetable body</i>,
  will <i>readily adhere</i> to, and <i>mingle</i> with, several clean
  <i>metalline bodies</i>.</p>

  <p>And that we may the better finde what the <i>cause</i> of
  <i>Congruity</i> and <i>Incongruity</i> in bodies is, it will be
  requisite to consider, First, what is the <i>cause</i> of
  <i>fluidness</i>; And this, <i>I conceive</i>, to be nothing else but a
  certain <i>pulse</i> or <i>shake</i> of <i>heat</i>; for Heat being
  nothing else but a very <i>brisk</i> and <i>vehement agitation</i> of the
  parts of a body (as I have elswhere made <i>probable</i>) the parts of a
  body are thereby made so <i>loose</i> from one another, that they easily
  <i>move any way</i>, and become <i>fluid</i>. That I may explain this a
  little by a gross Similitude, let us suppose a dish of sand set upon some
  body that is very much <i>agitated</i>, and shaken with some <i>quick</i>
  and <i>strong vibrating motion</i>, as on a <i>Milstone</i> turn'd round
  upon the under stone very violently whilst it is empty; or on a very
  stiff <i>Drum</i>-head, which is vehemently or very nimbly beaten with
  the Drumsticks. By this means, the sand in the dish, which before lay
  like a <i>dull</i> and unactive body, becomes a perfect <i>fluid</i>; and
  ye can no sooner make a <i>hole</i> in it with your finger, but it is
  immediately <i>filled up again</i>, and the upper surface of it
  <i>levell'd</i>. Nor can you <i>bury</i> a <i>light body</i>, as a piece
  of Cork under it, but it presently <i>emerges</i> or <i>swims</i> as
  'twere on the top; nor can you lay a <i>heavier</i> on the top of it, as
  a piece of Lead, but it is immediately <i>buried</i> in
  Sand, and (as 'twere) sinks to the bottom. Nor can you make a <i>hole</i>
  in the side of the Dish, but the sand shall <i>run out</i> of it to a
  <i>level</i>, not an <i>obvious property</i> of a fluid body, as such,
  but this dos <i>imitate</i>; and all this meerly caused by the vehement
  <i>agitation</i> of the conteining vessel; for by this means, <i>each</i>
  sand becomes to have a <i>vibrative</i> or <i>dancing</i> motion, so as
  no other heavier body can <i>rest</i> on it, unless <i>sustein'd</i> by
  some other on either side: Nor will it suffer any Body to be
  <i>beneath</i> it, unless it be a <i>heavier</i> then it self. Another
  Instance of the strange <i>loosening</i> nature of a violent jarring
  Motion, or a strong and nimble vibrative one, we may have from a piece of
  <i>iron</i> grated on very strongly with a <i>file</i>: for if into that
  a pin <i>screw'd</i> so firm and hard, that though it has a convenient
  head to it, yet it can by no means be <i>unscrew'd</i> by the fingers;
  if, I say, you attempt to unscrew this whilst <i>grated on by the
  file</i>, it will be found to undoe and turn very <i>easily</i>. The
  first of these Examples manifests, how a body actually <i>divided</i>
  into small parts, becomes a <i>fluid</i>. And the latter manifests by
  what means the agitation of heat so easily <i>loosens</i> and
  <i>unties</i> the parts of <i>solid</i> and <i>firm</i> bodies. Nor need
  we suppose heat to be any thing else, besides such a motion; for
  supposing we could <i>Mechanically</i> produce such a one <i>quick</i>
  and <i>strong</i> enough, we need not spend <i>fuel</i> to <i>melt</i> a
  body. Now, that I do not speak this altogether groundless, I must refer
  the Reader to the Observations I have made upon the shining sparks of
  Steel, for there he shall find that <i>the same</i> effects are produced
  upon small chips or parcels of Steel by the <i>flame</i>, and by <i>a
  quick and violent motion</i>; and if the body of <i>steel</i> may be thus
  melted (as I there shew it may) I think we have little reason to doubt
  that almost <i>any other</i> may not also. Every Smith can inform one how
  quickly both his <i>File</i> and the <i>Iron</i> grows <i>hot</i> with
  <i>filing</i>, and if you <i>rub</i> almost any two <i>hard</i> bodies
  together, they will do the same: And we know, that a sufficient degree of
  heat causes <i>fluidity</i>, in some bodies much sooner, and in others
  later; that is, the parts of the body of some are so <i>loose</i> from
  one another, and so <i>unapt to cohere</i>, and so <i>minute</i> and
  <i>little</i>, that a very <i>small</i> degree of agitation keeps them
  always in the <i>state of fluidity</i>. Of this kind, I suppose, the
  <i>Æther</i>, that is the <i>medium</i> or <i>fluid</i> body, in which
  all other bodies do as it were swim and move; and particularly, the
  <i>Air</i>, which seems nothing else but a kind of <i>tincture</i> or
  <i>solution</i> of terrestrial and aqueous particles <i>dissolv'd</i>
  into it, and agitated by it, just as the <i>tincture</i> of
  <i>Cocheneel</i> is nothing but some finer <i>dissoluble</i> parts of
  that Concrete lick'd up or <i>dissolv'd</i> by the <i>fluid</i> water.
  And from this Notion of it, we may easily give a more Intelligible reason
  how the Air becomes so capable of <i>Rarefaction</i> and
  <i>Condensation</i>. For, as in <i>tinctures</i>, one grain of some
  <i>strongly tinging</i> substance may <i>sensibly</i> colour some
  <i>hundred thousand</i> grains of <i>appropriated</i> Liquors, so as
  every <i>drop</i> of it has its proportionate share, and be sensibly
  ting'd, as I have try'd both with <i>Logwood</i> and <i>Cocheneel</i>:
  And as some few grains of <i>Salt</i> is able to infect as great a
  quantity, as may be found by <i>præcipitations</i>, though not so easily
  by the <i>sight</i> or <i>taste</i>; so the <i>Air</i>, which seems to be
  but as 'twere a <i>tincture</i> or <i>saline substance, dissolv'd and
  agitated by the fluid and agil Æther</i>, may disperse and
  <i>expand</i> it self into a <i>vast space</i>, if it have room enough,
  and infect, as it were, every part of that space. But, as on the other
  side, if there be but some <i>few grains</i> of the liquor, it may
  <i>extract all</i> the colour of the tinging substance, and may
  <i>dissolve</i> all the Salt, and thereby become <i>much more
  impregnated</i> with those substances, so may <i>all</i> the air that
  sufficed in a <i>rarfy'd state</i> to fill some <i>hundred thousand</i>
  spaces of Æther, be compris'd in only <i>one</i>, but in a position
  proportionable <i>dense</i>. And though we have not yet found out such
  <i>strainers</i> for Tinctures and Salts as we have for the Air, being
  yet unable to <i>separate</i> them from their dissolving liquors by any
  kind of <i>filtre</i>, without <i>præcipitation</i>, as we are able to
  <i>separate</i> the Air from the Æther by <i>Glass</i>, and several other
  bodies. And though we are yet unable and ignorant of the ways of
  <i>præcipitating</i> Air out of the Æther as we can Tinctures, and Salts
  out of several <i>dissolvents</i>; yet neither of these seeming
  <i>impossible</i> from the nature of the things, nor so <i>improbable</i>
  but that some happy future industry may find out ways to effect them;
  nay, further, since we find that Nature <i>does really perform</i>
  (though by what means we are not certain) both these actions, namely, by
  <i>præcipitating</i> the Air in Rain and Dews, and by supplying the
  Streams and Rivers of the World with fresh water, <i>strain'd</i> through
  secret subterraneous Caverns: And since, that in very many other
  <i>proprieties</i> they do so exactly <i>seem</i> of the <i>same
  nature</i>; till further observations or tryals do inform us of the
  <i>contrary</i>, we may <i>safely enough conclude</i> them of the <i>same
  kind</i>. For it seldom happens that any two natures have so many
  properties <i>coincident</i> or the <i>same</i>, as I have observ'd
  Solutions and Air to have, and to be <i>different</i> in the rest. And
  therefore I think it neither <i>impossible</i>, <i>irrational</i>, nay
  nor <i>difficult</i> to be able to <i>predict</i> what is <i>likely</i>
  to happen in other particulars also, besides those which
  <i>Observation</i> or <i>Experiment</i> have declared thus or thus;
  especially, if the <i>circumstances</i> that do often very much conduce
  to the variation of the effects be duly <i>weigh'd</i> and
  <i>consider'd</i>. And indeed, were there not a <i>probability</i> of
  this, our <i>inquiries</i> would be <i>endless</i>, our <i>tryals
  vain</i>, and our greatest <i>inventions</i> would be nothing but the
  meer <i>products</i> of <i>chance</i>, and not of <i>Reason</i>; and,
  like <i>Mariners</i> in an Ocean, destitute both of a <i>Compass</i> and
  the sight of the <i>Celestial guids</i>, we might indeed, <i>by
  chance</i>, Steer <i>directly</i> towards our desired Port, but 'tis <i>a
  thousand to one</i> but we <i>miss</i> our aim. But to proceed, we may
  hence also give a plain reason, how the Air comes to be <i>darkned</i> by
  <i>clouds</i>, &amp;c. which are nothing but a kind of
  <i>precipitation</i>, and how those <i>precipitations</i> fall down in
  <i>Showrs</i>. Hence also could I very easily, and I think truly, deduce
  the cause of the curious <i>sixangular figures</i> of Snow, and the
  appearances of <i>Haloes, &amp;c.</i> and the sudden <i>thickning</i> of
  the Sky with Clouds, and the <i>vanishing</i> and <i>disappearing</i> of
  those Clouds again; for all these things may be very easily
  <i>imitated</i> in a <i>glass of liquor</i>, with some slight <i>Chymical
  preparations</i> as I have often try'd, and may somewhere else more
  largely relate, but have not now time to set them down. But to proceed,
  there are other bodies that consist of particles more <i>Gross</i>, and
  of a more <i>apt</i> figure for <i>cohesion</i>, and this requires
  <i>somewhat greater</i> agitation; such, I suppose <img
  src="images/mercury.png" alt="Mercury"  />,
  <i>fermented vinous</i> <i>Spirits</i>, several
  <i>Chymical Oils</i>, which are much of kin to those Spirits, &amp;c.
  Others yet require a <i>greater</i>, as <i>water</i>, and so others
  <i>much greater</i>, for almost infinite degrees: For, I suppose there
  are very <i>few</i> bodies in the world that may not be made
  <i>aliquatenus</i> fluid, by <i>some</i> or <i>other</i> degree of
  agitation or heat.</p>

  <p>Having therefore in short set down my Notion of a Fluid body, I come
  in the next place to consider what <i>Congruity</i> is; and this, as I
  said before, being a <i>Relative property</i> of a fluid, whereby it may
  be said to be <i>like</i> or <i>unlike</i> to this or that other body,
  whereby it <i>does</i> or <i>does not mix</i> with this or that body. We
  will again have recourse to our former Experiment, though but a rude one;
  and here if we mix in the dish <i>several kinds</i> of sands, some of
  <i>bigger</i>, others of <i>less</i> and finer bulks, we shall find that
  by the agitation <i>the fine sand</i> will <i>eject</i> and <i>throw
  out</i> of it self all those <i>bigger</i> bulks of small <i>stones</i>
  and the like, and those will <i>be gathered</i> together all into
  <i>one</i> place; and if there be <i>other</i> bodies in it of other
  natures, those also will be <i>separated</i> into a place by themselves,
  and <i>united</i> or <i>tumbled</i> up together. And though this do not
  come up to the <i>highest property</i> of <i>Congruity</i>, which is a
  <i>Cohæsion</i> of the parts of the fluid together, or a kind of
  <i>attraction</i> and <i>tenacity</i>, yet this does as 'twere
  <i>shadow</i> it out, and somewhat resemble it; for just after the same
  manner, I suppose the <i>pulse</i> of heat to <i>agitate</i> the small
  parcels of matter, and those that are of a <i>like bigness</i>, and
  <i>figure</i>, and <i>matter</i>, will <i>hold</i>, or <i>dance</i>
  together, and those which are of a <i>differing</i> kind will be
  <i>thrust</i> or <i>shov'd</i> out from between them; for particles that
  are <i>similar</i>, will, like so many <i>equal musical strings equally
  stretcht</i>, vibrate together in a kind of <i>Harmony</i> or
  <i>unison</i>; whereas others that are <i>dissimilar</i>, upon what
  account soever, unless the disproportion be otherwise counter-ballanc'd,
  will, like so many <i>strings out of tune</i> to those unisons, though
  they have the same agitating <i>pulse</i>, yet make quite
  <i>differing</i> kinds of <i>vibrations</i> and <i>repercussions</i>, so
  that though they may be both mov'd, yet are their <i>vibrations</i> so
  <i>different</i>, and so <i>untun'd</i>, as 'twere to each other, that
  they <i>cross</i> and <i>jar</i> against each other, and consequently,
  <i>cannot agree</i> together, but <i>fly back</i> from each other to
  their similar particles. Now, to give you an instance how the
  <i>disproportion</i> of some bodies in one respect, may be
  <i>counter-ballanc'd</i> by a <i>contrary disproportion</i> of the same
  body in another respect, whence we find that the subtil <i>vinous
  spirit</i> is <i>congruous</i>, or does readily <i>mix</i> with
  <i>water</i>, which in many properties is of a very <i>differing
  nature</i>, we may consider that a <i>unison</i> may be made either by
  two <i>strings</i> of the same <i>bigness</i>, <i>length</i>, and
  <i>tension</i>, or by two strings of the same <i>bigness</i>, but of
  <i>differing length</i>, and a <i>contrary differing tension</i>, or
  <i>3ly.</i> by two strings of <i>unequal length</i> and <i>bigness</i>,
  and of a <i>differing tension</i>, or of <i>equal length</i>, and
  <i>differing bigness</i> and <i>tension</i>, and several other such
  varieties. To which <i>three properties</i> in <i>strings</i>, will
  correspond <i>three proprieties</i> also in <i>sand</i>, or the
  <i>particles</i> of bodies, their <i>Matter</i> or <i>Substance</i>,
  their <i>Figure</i> or <i>Shape</i>, and their <i>Body</i> or
  <i>Bulk</i>. And from the <i>varieties</i> of these <i>three</i>, may
  arise <i>infinite varieties</i> in fluid bodies, though all agitated by
  the <i>same pulse</i> or <i>vibrative</i> motion. And there may be as
  many ways of making Harmonies and Discords with these, as
  there may be with <i>musical strings</i>. Having therefore seen what is
  the cause of Congruity or Incongruity, those relative properties of
  fluids, we may, from what has been said, very easily collect, what is the
  <i>reason</i> of those Relative proprieties also between <i>fluid
  bodies</i> and <i>solid</i>; for since all bodies consist of
  <i>particles</i> of such a <i>Substance</i>, <i>Figure</i>, and
  <i>Bulk</i>; but in some they are <i>united</i> together more
  <i>firmly</i> then to be <i>loosened</i> from each other by every
  <i>vibrative</i> motion (though I imagine that there is no body in the
  world, but that some degree of agitation may, as I hinted before, agitate
  and loosen the particles so as to make them fluid) those <i>cohering</i>
  particles may <i>vibrate</i> in the same manner almost as those that are
  <i>loose</i> and become <i>unisons</i> or <i>discords</i>, as I may so
  speak, to them. Now that the <i>parts</i> of all <i>bodies</i>, though
  never so <i>solid</i>, do yet <i>vibrate</i>, I think we need go no
  further for proof, then that <i>all</i> bodies have some <i>degrees</i>
  of <i>heat</i> in them, and that there has not been yet found any thing
  <i>perfectly cold</i>: Nor can I believe indeed that there is any such
  thing in Nature, as a body whose particles are at <i>rest</i>, or
  <i>lazy</i> and <i>unactive</i> in the great <i>Theatre</i> of the
  <i>World</i>, it being quite <i>contrary</i> to the grand <i>Oeconomy</i>
  of the Universe. We see therefore what is the reason of the
  <i>sympathy</i> or uniting of some bodies together, and of the
  <i>antipathy</i> or flight of others from each other: For
  <i>Congruity</i> seems nothing else but a <i>Sympathy</i>, and
  <i>Incongruity</i> an <i>Antipathy</i> of bodies, hence <i>similar</i>
  bodies once <i>united</i> will not <i>easily part</i>, and
  <i>dissimilar</i> bodies once <i>disjoyn'd</i> will not <i>easily
  unite</i> again; from hence may be very easily deduc'd the reason of the
  <i>suspension</i> of <i>water</i> and <i>Quick-silver</i> above their
  usual <i>station</i>, as I shall more at large anon shew.</p>

  <p>These properties therefore (alwayes the concomitants of fluid bodies)
  produce these following visible <i>Effects</i>:</p>

  <p>First, They <i>unite</i> the parts of a fluid to its <i>similar</i>
  Solid, or keep them <i>separate</i> from its <i>dissimilar</i>. Hence
  <i>Quick-silver</i> will (as we noted before) <i>stick</i> to
  <i>Gold</i>, <i>Silver</i>, <i>Tin</i>, <i>Lead</i>, &amp;c. and
  <i>unite</i> with them: but <i>roul</i> off from <i>Wood</i>,
  <i>Stone</i>, <i>Glass</i>, &amp;c. if never so little scituated out of
  its <i>horizontal level</i>; and <i>water</i> that will <i>wet salt</i>
  and <i>dissolve</i> it, will <i>slip</i> off from <i>Tallow</i>, or the
  like, without at all <i>adhering</i>; as it may likewise be observed to
  do upon a <i>dusty</i> superficies. And next they cause the parts of
  <i>homogeneal fluid</i> bodies readily to <i>adhere</i> together and
  <i>mix</i>, and of <i>heterogeneal</i>, to be exceeding <i>averse</i>
  thereunto. Hence we find, that <i>two</i> small <i>drops</i> of
  <i>water</i>, on any superficies they can roul on, will, if they chance
  to touch each other, <i>readily unite</i> and <i>mix</i> into one
  3<sup>d</sup> <i>drop</i>: The like may be observed with two small
  <i>Bowls</i> of <i>Quick-silver</i> upon a Table or Glass, provided their
  surfaces be not <i>dusty</i>; and with two drops of <i>Oyl</i> upon fair
  water, <i>&amp;c</i>. And further, <i>water</i> put unto <i>wine</i>,
  <i>salt water</i>, <i>vinegar</i>, <i>spirit</i> of <i>wine</i>, or the
  like, does immediately (especially if they be shaken together)
  <i>disperse</i> it self all over them. Hence, on the contrary, we also
  find, that <i>Oyl of Tartar</i> poured upon <i>Quick-silver,</i> and
  <i>Spirit of Wine</i> on that <i>Oyl</i>, and <i>Oyl of Turpentine</i> on
  that <i>Spirit</i>, and <i>Air</i> upon that <i>Oyl</i>, though they be
  stopt closely up into a Bottle, and <i>shaken</i> never so much, they
  will by no means long suffer any of their bigger parts to be
  <i>united</i> or included within any of the other Liquors
  (by which recited Liquors, may be plainly enough represented the four
  <i>Peripatetical Elements</i>, and the more subtil <i>Æther</i> above
  all.) From this property 'tis, that a drop of <i>water</i> does not
  mingle with, or vanish into <i>Air</i>, but is <i>driven</i> (by that
  Fluid equally protruding it on every side) and forc't into as little a
  space as it can possibly be contained in, namely, into a <i>Round
  Globule</i>. So likewise a little <i>Air</i> blown under the
  <i>water</i>, is <i>united</i> or thrust into a <i>Bubble</i> by the
  ambient water. And a parcel of <i>Quick-silver</i> enclosed with
  <i>Air</i>, <i>Water</i>, or almost any other <i>Liquor</i>, is
  <i>formed</i> into a <i>round Ball</i>.</p>

  <p>Now the cause why all these included Fluids, newly mentioned, or as
  many others as are wholly included within a heterogeneous fluid, are not
  <i>exactly</i> of a <i>Spherical Figure</i> (seeing that if caused by
  these Principles only, it could be of no other) must proceed from some
  other kind of <i>pressure</i> against the two opposite flatted sides.
  This <i>adventitious</i> or <i>accidental pressure</i> may proceed from
  <i>divers causes</i>, and accordingly must <i>diversifie</i> the Figure
  of the included heterogeneous fluid: For seeing that a body may be
  included either with a fluid only, or only with a solid, or partly with a
  fluid, and partly with a solid, or partly with one fluid, and partly with
  another; there will be found a very great variety of the terminating
  <i>surfaces</i>, much differing from a <i>Spherical</i>, according to the
  various resistance or pressure that belongs to each of these encompassing
  bodies.</p>

  <p>Which Properties may in general be deduced from two heads, <i>viz.</i>
  <i>Motion</i>, and <i>Rest</i>. For, either this Globular Figure is
  altered by a <i>natural Motion</i>, such as is <i>Gravity</i>, or a
  <i>violent</i>, such as is any <i>accidental motion</i> of the fluids, as
  we see in the <i>wind</i> ruffling up the water, and the <i>purlings</i>
  of <i>Streams</i>, and <i>foaming</i> of <i>Catarracts</i>, and the like.
  Or thirdly, By the <i>Rest</i>, <i>Firmness</i> and <i>Stability</i> of
  the ambient <i>Solid</i>. For if the including <i>Solid</i> be of an
  <i>angular</i> or any other <i>irregular</i> Form, the included
  <i>fluid</i> will be near of the <i>like</i>, as a Pint-<i>Pot</i> full
  of <i>water</i>, or a <i>Bladder</i> full of <i>Air</i>. And next, if the
  including or included fluid have a greater <i>gravity</i> one than
  another, then will the <i>globular</i> Form be deprest into an
  <i>Elliptico-spherical</i>: As if, for example, we suppose the Circle
  <i>ABCD</i>, in the <i>fourth Figure</i>, to represent a <i>drop of
  water</i>, <i>Quick-silver</i>, or the like, included with the <i>Air</i>
  or the like, which supposing there were no <i>gravity</i> at all in
  either of the <i>fluids</i>, or that the <i>contained</i> and
  <i>containing</i> were of the <i>same weight,</i> would be <i>equally
  comprest</i> into an exactly <i>spherical</i> body (the ambient fluid
  <i>forcing equally</i> against every side of it.) But supposing either a
  greater <i>gravity</i> in the included, by reason whereof the parts of it
  being <i>prest</i> from <i>A</i> towards <i>B</i>, and thereby the whole
  put into <i>motion</i>, and that <i>motion</i> being <i>hindred</i> by
  the <i>resistance</i> of the <i>subjacent</i> parts of the ambient, the
  <i>globular</i> Figure <i>ADBC</i> will be <i>deprest</i> into the
  <i>Elliptico-spherical</i>, <i>EGFH</i>. For the side <i>A</i> is
  <i>detruded</i> to <i>E</i> by the <i>Gravity</i>, and <i>B</i> to
  <i>F</i> by the <i>resistance</i> of the subjacent medium: and therefore
  <i>C</i> must necessarily be thrust to <i>G</i>; and <i>D</i> to
  <i>H</i>. Or else, supposing a greater <i>gravity</i> in the
  <i>ambient</i>, by whose more then ordinary <i>pressure</i> against the
  under side of the included globule; <i>B</i> will be forced to <i>F</i>,
  and by its <i>resistance</i> of the motion <i>upwards</i>, the
  side <i>A</i> will be <i>deprest</i> to <i>E</i>, and therefore <i>C</i>
  being thrust to <i>G</i> and <i>D</i> to <i>H</i>; the <i>globular</i>
  Figure by this means also will be made an <i>Elliptico-spherical</i>.
  Next if a fluid be included <i>partly</i> with one, and <i>partly</i>
  with another fluid, it will be found to be shaped <i>diversly</i>,
  according to the proportion of the <i>gravity</i> and <i>incongruity</i>
  of the 3 <i>fluids</i> one to another: As in the <i>second Figure</i>,
  let the upper <i>MMM</i> be <i>Air</i>, the middle <i>LMNO</i> be common
  <i>Oyl</i>, the lower <i>OOO</i> be <i>Water</i>, the <i>Oyl</i> will be
  form'd, not into a <i>spherical</i> Figure, such as is represented by the
  <i>pricked Line</i>, but into such a Figure as LMNO, whose side LMN will
  be of a flatter <i>Elliptical</i> Figure, by reason of the great
  disproportion between the <i>Gravity</i> of <i>Oyl</i> and <i>Air</i>,
  and the side LOM of a rounder, because of the smaller difference between
  the weight of <i>Oyl</i> and <i>Water</i>. Lastly, The <i>globular</i>
  Figure will be changed, if the <i>ambient</i> be partly <i>fluid</i> and
  partly <i>solid</i>. And here the termination of the incompassed
  <i>fluid</i> towards the incompassing is shap'd according to the
  proportion of the congruity or incongruity of the <i>fluids</i> to the
  <i>solids</i>, and of the gravity and incongruity of the <i>fluids</i>
  one to another. As suppose the subjacent <i>medium</i> that hinders an
  included fluids descent, be a <i>solid</i>, as let KI, in the <i>fourth
  Figure</i>, represent the smooth superficies of a <i>Table</i>; EGFH, a
  parcel of <i>running Mercury</i>; the side GFH will be more flatted,
  according to the proportion of the incongruity of the <i>Mercury</i> and
  <i>Air</i> to the <i>Wood</i>, and of the <i>gravity</i> of
  <i>Mercury</i> and <i>Air</i> one to another; The side GEH will likewise
  be a little more deprest by reason the subjacent parts are now at rest,
  which were before in motion.</p>

  <p>Or further in the <i>third figure</i>, let AILD represent an including
  <i>solid</i> medium of a cylindrical shape (as suppose a small <i>Glass
  Jar</i>) Let FGEMM represent a contain'd <i>fluid</i>, as water; this
  towards the bottom and sides, is figured according to the concavity of
  the <i>Glass</i>: But its upper <i>Surface</i>, (which by reason of its
  gravity, (not considering at all the Air above it, and so neither the
  congruity or incongruity of either of them to the Glass) should be
  terminated by part of a <i>Sphere</i> whose diameter should be the same
  with that of the earth, which to our sense would appear a straight
  <i>Line</i>, as FGE, Or which by reason of its having a greater congruity
  to Glass than Air has, (not considering its Gravity) would be thrust into
  a <i>concave Sphere</i>, as CHB, whose diameter would be the same with
  that of the concavity of the Vessel:) Its upper Surface, I say, by reason
  of its having a greater gravity then the Air, and having likewise a
  greater congruity to Glass then the Air has, is terminated, by a
  <i>concave Elliptico-spherical Figure</i>, as CKB. For by its congruity
  it easily conforms it self, and adheres to the Glass, and constitutes as
  it were one containing body with it, and therefore should thrust the
  contained Air on that side it touches it, into a <i>spherical</i> Figure,
  as BHC, but the motion of Gravity depressing a little the Corners B and
  C, reduces it into the aforesaid Figure CKB. Now that it is the greater
  congruity of one of the two <i>contiguous fluids</i>, then of the other,
  to the containing <i>solid</i>, that causes the separating surfaces to be
  thus or thus figured: And that it is not because this or that figurated
  surface is more proper, natural, or peculiar to one of these
  fluid bodies, then to the other, will appear from this; that the same
  <i>fluids</i> will by being put into differing <i>solids</i>, change
  their <i>surfaces</i>. For the same water, which in a Glass or wooden
  Vessel will have a concave surface upwards, and will rise higher in a
  smaller then a greater Pipe, the same water, I say, in the same Pipes
  greased over or oyled, will produce quite contrary effects; for it will
  have a <i>protuberant</i> and <i>convex</i> surface upwards, and will not
  rise so high in small, as in bigger Pipes: Nay, in the very same solid
  Vessel, you may make the very same two contiguous <i>Liquids</i> to alter
  their Surfaces; for taking a small Wine-glass, or such like Vessel, and
  pouring water gently into it, you shall perceive the <i>surface</i> of
  the water all the way <i>concave</i>, till it rise even with the top,
  when you shall find it (if you gently and carefully pour in more) to grow
  very <i>protuberant</i> and <i>convex</i>; the reason of which is plain,
  for that the <i>solid</i> sides of the containing body are no longer
  extended, to which the water does more readily adhere then the air; but
  it is henceforth to be included with air, which would reduce it into a
  <i>hemisphere</i>, but by reason of its <i>gravity</i>, it is flatted
  into an <i>Oval</i>. <i>Quicksilver</i> also which to <i>Glass</i> is
  more incongruous then <i>Air</i> (and thereby being put into a
  <i>Glass-pipe</i>, will not adhere to it, but by the more <i>congruous
  air</i> will be forced to have a very <i>protuberant</i> surface, and to
  rise higher in a greater then a lesser Pipe) this <i>Quicksilver</i> to
  clean <i>Metal</i>, especially to <i>Gold</i>, <i>Silver</i>, <i>Tin</i>,
  <i>Lead</i>, &amp;c. <i>Iron</i> excepted, is more <i>congruous</i> then
  <i>Air</i>, and will not only stick to it, but have a <i>concave</i>
  Surface like <i>water</i>, and rise higher in a less, then in a greater
  Pipe.</p>

  <p>In all these Examples it is evident, that there is an
  <i>extraordinary</i> and <i>adventitious force</i>, by which the
  <i>globular</i> Figure of the contained <i>heterogeneous</i> fluid is
  altered; neither can it be imagined, how it should otherwise be of any
  other Figure then <i>Globular</i>: For being by the <i>heterogeneous</i>
  fluid equally <i>protruded</i> every way, whatsoever part is
  <i>protuberant</i>, will be thereby <i>deprest</i>. From this cause it
  is, that in its effects it does very much resemble a <i>round Spring</i>
  (such as a <i>Hoop</i>.) For as in a <i>round Spring</i> there is
  required an additional <i>pressure</i> against two opposite sides, to
  reduce it into an <i>Oval</i> Form, or to force it in between the sides
  of a <i>Hole,</i> whose <i>Diameter</i> is less then that of the
  <i>Spring</i>, there must be a considerable force or <i>protusion</i>
  against <i>the concave</i> or inner side of the <i>Spring</i>; So to
  alter this <i>spherical</i> constitution of an included fluid body, there
  is required more pressure against opposite sides to reduce it into an
  <i>Oval</i>; and, to press it into an <i>Hole</i> less in <i>Diameter</i>
  then it self, it requires a greater <i>protrusion</i> against all the
  other sides, What degrees of force are requisite to reduce them into
  longer and longer <i>Ovals</i>, or to press them into less and less
  <i>holes</i>, I have not yet experimentally calculated; but thus much by
  experiment I find in general, that there is alwayes required a greater
  pressure to close them into longer <i>Ovals</i>, or protude them into
  smaller <i>holes</i>. The necessity and reason of this, were it
  requisite, I could easily explain: but being not so necessary, and
  requiring more room and time then I have for it at present, I shall here
  omit it; and proceed to shew, that this may be presently found true, if
  Experiment be made with a <i>round Spring</i> (the way of
  making which trials is <i>obvious</i> enough.) And with the fluid bodies
  of <i>Mercury</i>, <i>Air</i>, <i>&amp;c</i>, the way of trying which,
  will be somewhat more difficult; and therefore I shall in brief describe
  it. He therefore that would try with <i>Air</i>, must first be provided
  of a <i>Glass-pipe</i>, made of the shape of that in the <i>fifth
  Figure</i>, whereof the side AB, represents a straight <i>Tube</i> of
  about three foot long, C, represents another part of it, which consists
  of a <i>round Bubble</i>; so ordered, that there is left a <i>passage</i>
  or <i>hole</i> at the top, into which may be fastened with <i>cement</i>
  several <i>small Pipes</i> of determinate <i>cylindrical</i> cavities: as
  let <i>hollow</i> of</p>

  &amp;c----
</pre>
  <p>There may be added as many more, as the Experimenter shall think fit,
  with holes continually decreasing by known quantities, so far as his
  senses are able to help him; I say, so far, because there may be made
  <i>Pipes</i> so small that it will be impossible to perceive the
  <i>perforation</i> with ones naked eye, though by the help of a
  <i>Microscope</i>, it may easily enough be perceived: Nay, I have made a
  <i>Pipe</i> perforated from end to end, so small, that with my naked eye
  I could very hardly see the body of it, insomuch that I have been able to
  knit it up into a knot without breaking: And more accurately examining
  one with my <i>Microscope</i>, I found it not so big as a sixteenth part
  of one of the smaller hairs of my head which was of the smaller and finer
  sort of hair, so that sixteen of these <i>Pipes</i> bound faggot-wise
  together, would but have equalized one single hair; how small therefore
  must its <i>perforation</i> be? It appearing to me through the
  <i>Microscope</i> to be a proportionably <i>thick-sided Pipe</i>.</p>

  <p>To proceed then, for the trial of the Experiment, the Experimenter
  must place the <i>Tube</i> AB, perpendicular, and fill the <i>Pipe</i> F
  (cemented into the hole E) with water, but leave the <i>bubble</i> C full
  of <i>Air</i>, and then gently pouring in water into the Pipe AB, he must
  observe diligently how high the water will rise in it before it protrude
  the <i>bubble</i> of Air C, through the narrow passage of F, and denote
  exactly the height of the <i>Cylinder</i> of water, then cementing in a
  second Pipe as G, and filling it with water; he may proceed as with the
  former, denoting likewise the height of the <i>Cylinder</i> of water,
  able to protrude the <i>bubble</i> C through the passage of G, the like
  may he do with the next <i>Pipe</i>, and the next, <i>&amp;c.</i> as far
  as he is able: then comparing the several heights of the
  <i>Cylinders</i>, with the several <i>holes</i> through which each
  <i>Cylinder</i> did force the <i>air</i> (having due regard to the
  <i>Cylinders</i> of water in the small <i>Tubes</i>) it will be very
  easie to determine, what force is requisite to press the <i>Air</i> into
  such and such <i>a hole</i>, or (to apply it to our present experiment)
  how much of the pressure of the <i>Air</i> is
  taken off by its ingress into smaller and smaller <i>holes</i>. From the
  application of which to the entring of the <i>Air</i> into the bigger
  <i>hole</i> of the <i>Vessel</i>, and into the smaller <i>hole</i> of the
  <i>Pipe</i>, we shall clearly find, that there is a greater pressure of
  the air upon the water in the <i>Vessel</i> or greater <i>pipe</i>, then
  there is upon that in the lesser <i>pipe</i>: For since the pressure of
  the <i>air</i> every way is found to be equal, that is, as much as is
  able to press up and sustain a <i>Cylinder</i> of <i>Quicksilver</i> of
  two foot and a half high, or thereabouts; And since of this pressure so
  many more degrees are required to force the <i>Air</i> into a smaller
  then into a greater <i>hole</i> that is full of a more congruous fluid.
  And lastly, since those degrees that are requisite to press it in, are
  thereby taken off from the <i>Air</i> within, and the <i>Air</i> within
  left with so many degrees of pressure less then the <i>Air</i> without;
  it will follow, that the <i>Air</i> in the less <i>Tube</i> or
  <i>pipe</i>, will have less pressure against the superficies of the
  <i>water</i> therein, then the <i>Air</i> in the bigger: which was the
  minor Proposition to be proved.</p>

  <p>The Conclusion therefore will necessarily follow, <i>viz.</i> That
  <i>this unequal pressure of the Air caused by its ingress into unequal
  holes, is a cause sufficient to produce this effect, without the help of
  any other concurrent</i>; therefore is probably the principal (if not the
  only) cause of these <i>Phænomena</i>.</p>

  <p>This therefore being thus explained, there will be divers
  <i>Phænomena</i> explicable thereby, as, the rising of <i>Liquors</i> in
  a <i>Filtre</i>, the rising of <i>Spirit of Wine</i>, <i>Oyl</i>,
  <i>melted Tallow</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> in the <i>Week</i> of a <i>Lamp</i>,
  (though made of small <i>Wire</i>, <i>Threeds</i> of <i>Asbestus</i>,
  <i>Strings</i> of <i>Glass</i>, or the like) the rising of <i>Liquors</i>
  in a <i>Spunge</i>, piece of <i>Bread</i>, <i>Sand</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>
  perhaps also the ascending of the <i>Sap</i> in <i>Trees</i> and
  <i>Plants</i>, through their small, and some of them <i>imperceptible
  pores</i>, (of which I have said more, on another occasion) at least the
  passing of it out of the earth into their roots. And indeed upon the
  consideration of this Principle, multitudes of other uses of it occurr'd
  to me, which I have not yet so well examined and digested as to propound
  for <i>Axioms</i>, but only as <i>Queries</i> and <i>Conjectures</i>
  which may serve as <i>hints</i> toward some further
  <i>discoveries</i>.</p>

  <p>As first, Upon the consideration of the <i>congruity</i> and
  <i>incongruity</i> of Bodies, as to <i>touch</i>, I found also the like
  <i>congruity</i> and <i>incongruity</i> (if I may so speak) as to the
  <i>Transmitting</i> of the <i>Rates</i> of Light: For as in this regard,
  <i>water</i> (not now to mention other Liquors) seems nearer of affinity
  to <i>Glass</i> then <i>Air</i>, and <i>Air</i> then <i>Quicksilver</i>:
  whence an <i>oblique Ray</i> out of <i>Glass</i>, will pass into
  <i>water</i> with very little <i>refraction</i> from the
  <i>perpendicular</i>, but none out of <i>Glass</i> into <i>Air</i>,
  excepting a <i>direct</i>, will pass without a very great refraction from
  the perpendicular, nay any oblique Ray under thirty degrees, will not be
  admitted into the Air at all. And <i>Quicksilver</i> will neither admit
  oblique or direct, but reflects all; seeming, as to the transmitting of
  the Raies of Light, to be of a quite differing constitution, from that of
  <i>Air</i>, <i>Water</i>, <i>Glass</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> and to resemble
  most those opacous and strong reflecting bodies of Metals: So also as to
  the property of cohesion or congruity, Water seems to keep the same
  order, being more congruous to Glass then Air, and Air
  then Quicksilver.</p>

  <p>A Second thing (which was hinted to me, by the consideration of the
  included fluids globular form, caused by the protrusion of the ambient
  heterogeneous fluid) was, whether the <i>Phænomena</i> of gravity might
  not by this means be explained, by supposing the <i>Globe</i> of Earth,
  Water, and Air to be included with a <i>fluid</i>, heterogeneous to all
  and each of them, so subtil, as not only to be every where
  <i>interspersed</i> through the <i>Air</i>, (or rather the <i>air</i>
  through it) but to <i>pervade</i> the bodies of <i>Glass</i>, and even
  the <i>closest Metals</i>, by which means it may endeavour to
  <i>detrude</i> all earthly bodies as far from it as it can; and partly
  thereby, and partly by other of its properties may move them towards the
  Center of the Earth. Now that there is some such fluid, I could produce
  many Experiments and Reasons, that do seem to prove it: But because it
  would ask some time and room to set them down and explain them, and to
  consider and answer all the Objections (many whereof I foresee) that may
  be alledged against it; I shall at present proceed to other
  <i>Queries</i>, contenting my self to have here only given a hint of what
  I may say more elswhere.</p>

  <p>A Third <i>Query</i> then was, Whether the <i>heterogeneity</i> of the
  <i>ambient fluid</i> may not be accounted a <i>secondary cause</i> of the
  <i>roundness</i> or <i>globular form</i> of the <i>greater bodies</i> of
  the world, such as are those of the <i>Sun</i>, <i>Stars</i>, and
  <i>Planets</i>, the <i>substance</i> of each of which seems altogether
  <i>heterogeneous</i> to the <i>circum-ambient fluid æther</i>? And of
  this I shall say more in the Observation of the Moon.</p>

  <p>A Fourth was, Whether the <i>globular form</i> of the <i>smaller
  parcels</i> of matter here upon the <i>Earth</i>, as that of
  <i>Fruits</i>, <i>Pebbles</i>, or <i>Flints</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> (which
  seem to have been a <i>Liquor</i> at first) may not be caused by the
  <i>heterogeneous ambient fluid</i>. For thus we see that melted
  <i>Glass</i> will be naturally formed into a <i>round Figure</i>; so
  likewise any small Parcel of any <i>fusible body</i>, if it be perfectly
  enclosed by the <i>Air</i>, will be driven into a <i>globular</i> Form;
  and, when cold, will be found a <i>solid Ball</i>. This is plainly enough
  manifested to us by their way of making <i>shot</i> with the <i>drops of
  Lead</i>; which being a very pretty curiosity, and known but to a very
  few, and having the liberty of publishing it granted me, by that
  <i>Eminent Virtuoso</i> Sir <i>Robert Moray</i>, who brought in this
  Account of it to the <i>Royal Society</i>, I have here transcribed and
  inserted.</p>

<h3>To make small shot of different sizes; Communicated by his
Highness <i>P.R.</i></h3>

  <p><i>Take Lead out of the Pig what quantity you please, melt it down,
  stir and clear it with an iron Ladle, gathering together the blackish
  parts that swim at top like scum, and when you see the colour of the
  clear Lead to be greenish, but no sooner, strew upon it
  </i>Auripigmentum<i> powdered according to the
  quantity of Lead, about as much as will lye upon a half Crown piece will
  serve for eighteen or twenty pound weight of some sorts of Lead; others
  will require more, or less. After the </i>Auripigmentum<i> is put in,
  stir the Lead well, and the </i>Auripigmentum<i> will flame: when the
  flame is over, take out some of the Lead in a Ladle having a lip or notch
  in the brim for convenient pouring out of the Lead, and being well warmed
  amongst the melted Lead, and with a stick make some single drops of Lead
  trickle out of the Ladle into water in a Glass, which if they fall to be
  round and without tails, there is </i>Auripigmentum<i> enough put in, and
  the temper of the heat is right, otherwise put in more. Then lay two bars
  of Iron (or some more proper Iron-tool made on purpose) upon a Pail of
  water, and place upon them a round Plate of Copper, of the size and
  figure of an ordinary large Pewter or Silver Trencher, the hollow whereof
  is to be about three inches over, the bottom lower then the brims about
  half an inch, pierced with thirty, forty, or more small holes; the
  smaller the holes are, the smaller the shot will be; and the brim is to
  be thicker then the bottom, to conserve the heat the better.</i></p>

  <p><i>The bottom of the Trencher being some four inches distant from the
  water in the Pail, lay upon it some burning Coles, to keep the Lead
  melted upon it. Then with the hot Ladle take Lead off the Pot where it
  stands melted, and pour it softly upon the burning Coles over the bottom
  of the Trencher, and it will immediately run through the holes into the
  water in small round drops. Thus pour on new Lead still as fast as it
  runs through the Trencher till all be done; blowing now and then the
  Coles with hand-Bellows, when the Lead in the Trencher cools so as to
  stop from running.</i></p>

  <p><i>While one pours on the Lead, another must, with another Ladle,
  thrusted four or five inches under water in the Pail, catch from time to
  time some of the shot, as it drops down, to see the size of it, and
  whether there be any faults in it. The greatest care is to keep the Lead
  upon the Trencher in the right degree of heat; if it be too cool, it will
  not run through the Trencher, though it stand melted upon it; and this is
  to be helped by blowing the Coals a little, or
  pouring on new Lead that is hotter: but the cooler the Lead, the larger
  the Shot; and the hotter, the smaller; when it it too hot, the drops will
  crack and fly; then you must stop pouring on new Lead, and let it cool;
  and so long as you observe the right temper of the heat, the Lead will
  constantly drop into very round Shot, without so much as one with a tail
  in many pounds.</i></p>

  <p><i>When all is done, take your Shot out of the Pail of water, and put
  it in a Frying-pan over the fire to dry them, which must be done warily,
  still shaking them that they melt not; and when they are dry you may
  separate the small from the great, in Pearl Sives made of Copper or
  Lattin let into one another, into as many sizes at you please. But if you
  would have your Shot larger then the Trencher makes them, you may do it
  with a Stick, making them trickle out of the Ladle, as hath been
  said.</i></p>

  <p><i>If the Trencher be but toucht a very little when the Lead stops
  from going through it, and be not too cool, it will drop again, but it it
  better not to touch it at all. At the melting of the Lead take care that
  there be no kind of Oyl, Grease, or the like, upon the Pots, or Ladles,
  or Trencher.</i></p>

  <p><i>The Chief cause of this Globular Figure of the Shot, seems to be
  the </i>Auripigmentum<i>; for, as soon as it is put in among the melted
  Lead, it loses its shining brightness, contracting instantly a grayish
  film or skin upon it, when you scum it to make it clean with the Ladle.
  So that when the Air comes at the falling drop of the melted Lead, that
  skin constricts them every where equally: but upon what account, and
  whether this be the true cause, is left to further disquisition.</i></p>

  <p>Much after this same manner, when the Air is exceeding cold through
  which it passes; do we find the drops of Rain, falling from the Clouds,
  congealed into round Hail-stones by the freezing Ambient.</p>

  <p>To which may be added this other known Experiment, That if you gently
  let fall a drop of <i>water</i> upon small <i>sand</i> or <i>dust</i>,
  you shall find, as it were, an artificial <i>round stone</i> quickly
  generated. I cannot upon this occasion omit the mentioning of the strange
  kind of <i>Grain</i>, which I have observed in a <i>stone</i> brought
  from <i>Kettering</i> in <i>Northamptonshire</i>, and therefore called by
  Masons <i>Kettering-Stone</i>, of which see the Description.
  Which brings into my mind what I long since observed in the fiery Sparks
  that are struck out of a Steel. For having a great desire to see what was
  left behind, after the Spark was gone out, I purposely struck fire over a
  very white piece of Paper, and observing diligently where some
  conspicuous sparks went out, I found a very little black spot no bigger
  then the point of a Pin, which through a <i>Microscope</i> appeared to be
  a perfectly round Ball, looking much like a polisht ball of Steel,
  insomuch that I was able to see the Image of the window reflected from
  it. I cannot here stay (having done it more fully in another place) to
  examine the particular Reasons of it, but shall only hint, that I imagine
  it to be some small parcel of the Steel, which by the violence of the
  motion of the stroke (most of which seems to be imprest upon those small
  parcels) is made so glowing hot, that it is melted into a <i>Vitrum</i>,
  which by the ambient Air is thrust into the form of a Ball.</p>

  <p>A Fifth thing which I thought worth Examination was, Whether the
  motion of all kind of Springs, might not be reduced to the Principle
  whereby the included <i>heterogeneous fluid</i> seems to be moved; or to
  that whereby two Solids, as Marbles, or the like, are thrust and kept
  together by the <i>ambient fluid</i>.</p>

  <p>A Sixth thing was, Whether the Rising and Ebullition of the Water out
  of Springs and Fountains (which lie much higher from the Center of the
  Earth then the Superficies of the Sea, from whence it seems to be
  derived) may not be explicated by the rising of Water in a smaller Pipe:
  For the Sea-water being strained through the Pores or Crannies of the
  Earth, is, as it were, included in little Pipes, where the pressure of
  the Air has not so great a power to resist its rising: But examining this
  way, and finding in it several difficulties almost irremovable, I thought
  upon a way that would much more naturally and conceivably explain it,
  which was by this following Experiment: I took a Glass-Tube, of the form
  of that described in the sixth Figure, and chusing two <i>heterogeneous
  fluids</i>, such as Water and Oyl, I poured in as much Water as filled up
  the Pipes as high as AB, then putting in some Oyl into the Tube AC, I
  deprest the superficies A of the Water to F, and B I raised to G, which
  was not so high perpendicularly as the superficies of the Oyl F, by the
  space FI, wherefore the proportion of the gravity of these two Liquors
  was as GH to FE.</p>

  <p>This Experiment I tried with several other Liquors, and particularly
  with fresh Water and Salt (which I made by dissolving Salt in warm Water)
  which two though they are nothing heterogeneous, yet before they would
  perfectly mix one with another, I made trial of the Experiment: Nay,
  letting the Tube wherein I tried the Experiment remain for many dayes, I
  observed them not to mix; but the superficies of the fresh was rather
  more then less elevated above that of the Salt. Now the proportion of the
  gravity of Sea-water, to that of River-water, according to
  <i>Stevinus</i> and <i>Varenius</i>, and as I have since found pretty
  true by making trial my self, is as 46. to 45. that is, 46. Ounces of the
  salt Water will take up no more room then 45. of the
  fresh. Or reciprocally 45 pints of salt-water weigh as much as 46 of
  fresh.</p>

  <p>But I found the proportion of Brine to fresh Water to be near 13 to
  12: Supposing therefore GHM to represent the Sea, and FI the height of
  the Mountain above the Superficies of the Sea, FM a Cavern in the Earth,
  beginning at the bottom of the Sea, and terminated at the top of the
  Mountain, LM the Sand at the bottom, through which the Water is as it
  were strained, so as that the fresher parts are only permitted to
  transude, and the saline kept back; if therefore the proportion of G M to
  FM be as 45 to 46, then may the Cylinder of Salt-water GM make the
  Cylinder of Fresh-water to rise as high as E, and to run over at N. I
  cannot here stand to examine or confute their Opinion, who make the depth
  of the Sea, below its Superficies, to be no more perpendicularly measured
  then the height of the Mountains above it: 'Tis enough for me to say,
  there is no one of those that have asserted it, have experimentally known
  the perpendicular of either; nor shall I here determine, whether there
  may not be many other causes of the separation of the fresh water from
  the salt, as perhaps some parts of the Earth through which it is to pass,
  may contain a Salt, that mixing and uniting with the Sea-salt, may
  precipitate it; much after the same manner as the <i>Alkalizate</i> and
  <i>Acid Salts</i> mix and precipitate each other in the preparation of
  <i>Tartarum Vitriolatum.</i> I know not also whether the exceeding cold
  (that must necessarily be) at the bottom of the Water, may not help
  towards this separation, for we find, that warm Water is able to dissolve
  and contain more Salt, then the same cold; insomuch that Brines strongly
  impregnated by heat, if let cool, do suffer much of their Salt to subside
  and crystallize about the bottom and sides. I know not also whether the
  exceeding pressure of the parts of the Water one against another, may not
  keep the Salt from descending to the very bottom, as finding little or no
  room to insert it self between those parts, protruded so violently
  together, or else squeeze it upwads into the superiour parts of the Sea,
  where it may more easily obtain room for it self, amongst the parts of
  the Water, by reason that there is more heat and less pressure. To this
  Opinion I was somewhat the more induced by the relations I have met with
  in <i>Geographical Writers</i>, of drawing fresh Water from the bottom of
  the Sea, which is salt above. I cannot now stand to examine, whether this
  natural perpetual motion may not artificially be imitated: Nor can I
  stand to answer the Objections which may be made against this my
  Supposition: As, First, How it comes to pass, that there are sometimes
  salt Springs much higher then the Superficies of the Water? And,
  Secondly, Why Springs do not run faster and slower, according to the
  varying height made of the Cylinder of Sea-water, by the ebbing and
  flowing of the Sea?</p>

  <p>As to the First, In short, I say, the fresh Water may receive again a
  saline Tincture near the Superficies of the Earth, by passing through
  some salt <i>Mines</i>, or else many of the saline parts of the Sea may
  be kept back, though not all.</p>

  <p>And as to the Second, The same <i>Spring</i> may be fed and supplyed
  by divers <i>Caverns</i>, coming from very far distant parts of the
  <i>Sea</i>, so as that it may in one place be <i>high</i>, in another
  <i>low water</i>; and so by that means the <i>Spring</i> may be equally
  supply'd at all times. Or else the <i>Cavern</i> may be so straight and
  narrow, that the water not having so ready and free passage through it,
  cannot upon so short and quick mutations of pressure, be able to produce
  any sensible effect at such a distance. Besides that, to confirm this
  <i>hypothesis</i>, there are many <i>Examples</i> found in <i>Natural
  Historians</i>, of <i>Springs</i> that do ebb and flow like the Sea: As
  particularly, those recorded by the Learned <i>Camden</i>, and after him
  by <i>Speed,</i> to be found in this <i>Island</i>: One of which, they
  relate to be on the Top of a Mountain, by the small Village <i>Kilken</i>
  in <i>Flintshire</i>, <i>Maris æmulus qui statis temporibus suos evomit
  &amp; resorbet Aquas</i>; Which at certain times riseth and falleth after
  the manner of the Sea. A Second in <i>Caermardenshire,</i> near
  <i>Caermarden</i>, at a place called <i>Cantred Bichan</i>; <i>Qui (ut
  scribit Giraldus) naturali die bis undis deficiens, &amp; toties
  exuberans, marinas imitatur instabilitates</i>; That twice in four and
  twenty hours ebbing and flowing; resembleth the unstable motions of the
  Sea. The <i>Phænomena</i> of which two may be easily made out, by
  supposing the <i>Cavern</i>, by which they are fed, to arise from the
  bottom of the next Sea. A Third, is a Well upon the River <i>Ogmore</i>
  in <i>Glamorganshire</i>, and near unto <i>Newton</i>, of which
  <i>Camden</i> relates himself to be certified, by a Letter from a Learned
  Friend of his that observed it, <i>Fons abest hinc, &amp;c.</i> The
  Letter is a little too long to be inserted, but the substance is this;
  That this Well ebbs and flows quite contrary to the flowing and ebbing of
  the Sea in those parts: for 'tis almost empty at Full Sea, but full at
  Low water. This may happen from the Channel by which it is supplied,
  which may come from the bottom of a Sea very remote from those parts, and
  where the Tides are much differing from those of the approximate shores.
  A Fourth, lies in <i>Westmorland</i>, near the River <i>Leder</i>; <i>Qui
  instar Euripi sæpius in die reciprocantibus undis fluit &amp;
  refluit</i>, which ebbs and flows many times a day. This may proceed from
  its being supplyed from many Channels, coming from several parts of the
  Sea, lying sufficiently distant asunder to have the times of High-water
  differing enough one from the other; so as that whensoever it shall be
  High water over any of those places, where these Channels begin, it shall
  likewise be so in the Well; but this is but a supposition.</p>

  <p>A Seventh <i>Query</i> was, Whether the <i>dissolution</i> or mixing
  of several bodies, whether fluid or solid, with saline or other Liquors,
  might not partly be attributed to this Principle of the congruity of
  those bodies and their dissolvents? As of Salt in Water, Metals in
  several <i>Menstruums</i>, Unctuous Gums in Oyls, the mixing of Wine and
  Water, <i>&amp;c.</i> And whether <i>precipitation</i> be not partly made
  from the same Principle of Incongruity? I say <i>partly</i>, because
  there are in some Dissolutions, some other Causes concurrent.</p>

  <p>I shall lastly make a much more seemingly strange and unlikely
  <i>Query</i>; and that is, Whether this Principle, well examined and
  explained, may not be found a <i>co-efficient</i> in the
  most considerable Operations of Nature? As in those of <i>Heat</i>, and
  <i>Light</i> consequently of <i>Rarefaction</i> and <i>Condensation</i>,
  <i>Hardness</i>, and <i>Fluidness</i>, <i>Perspicuity</i> and
  <i>Opacousness</i>, <i>Refractions</i> and <i>Colours. &amp;c.</i> Nay, I
  know not whether there may be many things done in Nature, in which this
  may not (be said to) have a Finger? This I have in some other passages of
  this Treatise further enquired into and shewn, that as well <i>Light</i>
  as <i>Heat</i> may be caused by <i>corrosion</i>, which is applicable to
  <i>congruity</i>, and consequently all the rest will be but
  <i>subsequents</i>: In the mean time I would not willingly be guilty of
  that <i>Error</i>, which the thrice Noble and Learned <i>Verulam</i>
  justly takes notice of, as such, and calls <i>Philosophiæ Genus
  Empiricum, quod in paucorum Experimentorum Angustiis &amp; Obscuritate
  fundatum est</i>. For I neither conclude from one single Experiment, nor
  are the Experiments I make use of all made upon one Subject: Nor wrest I
  any Experiment to make it <i>quadrare</i> with any preconceiv'd Notion.
  But on the contrary, I endeavour to be conversant in divers kinds of
  Experiments, and all and every one of those Trials, I make the Standards
  or Touchstones, by which I try all my former Notions, whether they hold
  out in weight, and measure, and touch, <i>&amp;c.</i> For as that Body is
  no other then a Counterfeit Gold, which wants any one of the Proprieties
  of Gold, (such as are the Malleableness, Weight, Colour, Fixtness in the
  Fire, Indissolubleness in <i>Aqua fortis</i>, and the like) though it has
  all the other; so will all those Notions be found to be false and
  deceitful, that will not undergo all the Trials and Tests made of them by
  Experiments. And therefore such as will not come up to the desired
  <i>Apex</i> of Perfection, I rather wholly reject and take new, then by
  piecing and patching, endeavour to retain the old, as knowing such things
  at best to be but lame and imperfect. And this course I learned from
  Nature; whom we find neglectful of the old Body, and suffering its
  Decaies and Infirmities to remain without repair, and altogether
  sollicitous and careful of perpetuating the <i>Species</i> by new
  <i>Individuals</i>. And it is certainly the most likely way to erect a
  glorious Structure and Temple to <i>Nature</i>, such as she will be found
  (by any <i>zealous Votary</i>) to reside in; to begin to build a new upon
  a sure Foundation of Experiments.</p>

  <p>But to digress no further from the consideration of the
  <i>Phænomena,</i> more immediately explicable by this Experiment, we
  shall proceed to shew, That, as to the rising of Water in a
  <i>Filtre</i>, the reason of it will be manifest to him, that does take
  notice, that a <i>Filtre</i> is constituted of a great number of small
  long solid bodies, which lie so close together, that the Air in its
  getting in between them, doth lose of its pressure that it has against
  the <i>Fluid</i> without them, by which means the Water or Liquor not
  finding so strong a resistance between them as is able to
  counter-ballance the pressure on its superficies without, is raised
  upward, till it meet with a pressure of the Air which is able to hinder
  it. And as to the Rising of Oyl, melted Tallow, Spirit of Wine,
  <i>&amp;c.</i> in the Week of a Candle or Lamp, it is evident, that it
  differs in nothing from the former, save only in this, that in a
  <i>Filtre</i> the Liquor descends and runs away by another part; and in
  the Week the Liquor is dispersed and carried away by the
  Flame; something there is ascribable to the Heat, for that it may rarifie
  the more volatil and spirituous parts of those combustible Liquors, and
  so being made lighter then the Air, it maybe protruded upwards by that
  more ponderous fluid body in the Form of Vapours; but this can be
  ascribed to the ascension of but a very little, and most likely of that
  only which ascends without the Week. As for the Rising of it in a Spunge,
  Bread, Cotton, <i>&amp;c.</i> above the superficies of the subjacent
  Liquor, what has been said about the <i>Filtre</i> (if considered) will
  easily suggest a reason, considering that all these bodies abound with
  small holes or pores.</p>

  <p>From this same Principle also (<i>viz. the unequal pressure of the Air
  against the unequal superficies of the water</i>) proceeds the cause of
  the accession or incursion of any floating body against the sides of the
  containing Vessel; or the <i>appropinquation</i> of two floating bodies,
  as <i>Bubbles</i>, <i>Corks</i>, <i>Sticks</i>, <i>Straws</i>,
  <i>&amp;c.</i> one towards another. As for instance, Take a Glass-jar,
  such as AB in the seventh <i>Figure</i>, and filling it pretty near the
  top with water, throw into it a small round piece of Cork, as C, and
  plunge it all over in water, that it be wet, so as that the water may
  rise up by the sides of it, then placing it any where upon the
  superficies, about an inch, or one inch and a quarter from any side, and
  you shall perceive it by degrees to make <i>perpendicularly</i> toward
  the nearest part of the side, and the nearer it approaches, the faster to
  be moved, the reason of which <i>Phænomenon</i> will be found no other
  then this, that the Air has a greater pressure against the middle of the
  <i>superficies</i>, then it has against those parts that approach nearer,
  and are <i>contiguous</i> to the sides. Now that the pressure is greater,
  may (as I shewed before in the explication of the third <i>Figure</i>) be
  evinced from the flatting of the water in the middle, which arises from
  the gravity of the under <i>fluid</i>: for since, as I shewed before, if
  there were no gravity in the under <i>fluid</i>, or that it were equal to
  that of the upper, the terminating Surface would be <i>Spherical</i>, and
  since it is the additional pressure of the gravity of water that makes it
  so flat, it follows, that the pressure upon the middle must be greater
  then towards the sides. Hence the Ball having a stronger pressure against
  that side of it which respects the middle of the <i>superficies</i>, then
  against that which respects the <i>approximate</i> side, must necessarily
  move towards that part, from whence it finds least resistance, and so be
  <i>accelerated</i>, as the resistance decrease. Hence the more the water
  is raised under that part of its way it is passing above the middle, the
  faster it is moved: And therefore you will find it to move faster in E
  then in D, and in D then in C. Neither could I find the floating
  substance to be moved at all, until it were placed upon some part of the
  <i>Superficies</i> that was sensibly elevated above the height of the
  middle part. Now that this may be the true cause, you may try with a
  blown Bladder, and an exactly round Ball upon a very smooth side of some
  pliable body, as <i>Horn</i> or <i>Quicksilver.</i> For if the Ball be
  placed under a part of the Bladder which is upon one side of the middle
  of its pressure, and you press strongly against the Bladder, you shall
  find the Ball moved from the middle towards the sides.</p>

  <p>Having therefore shewn the reason of the motion of any float towards
  the sides, the reason of the incursion of any two floating bodies will
  easily appear: For the rising of the water against the sides of either of
  them, is an Argument sufficient, to shew the pressure of the Air to be
  there less, then it is further from it, where it is not so much elevated;
  and therefore the reason of the motion of the other toward it, will be
  the same as towards the side of the Glass, only here from the same
  reason, they are mutually moved toward each other, whereas the side of
  the Glass in the former remains fixt. If also you gently fill the Jar so
  full with water, that the water is <i>protuberant</i> above the sides,
  the same piece of Cork that before did hasten towards the sides, does now
  fly from it as fast towards the middle of the Superficies; the reason of
  which will be found no other then this, that the pressure of the Air is
  stronger against the sides of the Superficies G and H, then against the
  middle I; for since, as I shewed before, the Principle of congruity would
  make the terminating Surface Spherical, and that the flatting of the
  Surface in the middle is from the abatement of the waters pressure
  outwards, by the contrary indeavour of its gravity; it follows that the
  pressure in the middle must be less then on the sides; and therefore the
  consecution will be the same as in the former. It is very odd to one that
  considers not the reason of it, to see two floating bodies of wood to
  approach each other, as though they were indued with some magnetical
  vigour; which brings into my mind what I formerly tried with a piece of
  Cork or such like body, which I so ordered, that by putting a little
  stick into the same water, one part of the said Cork would approach and
  make toward the stick, whereas another would discede and fly away, nay it
  would have a kind of verticity, so as that if the <i>Æquator</i> (as I
  may so speak) of the Cork were placed towards the stick, if let alone, it
  would instantly turn its appropriate Pole toward it, and then run a-tilt
  at it: and this was done only by taking a dry Cork, and wetting one side
  of it with one small stroak; for by this means gently putting it upon the
  water, it would depress the superficies on every side of it that was dry,
  and therefore the greatest pressure of the Air, being near those sides,
  caused it either to chase away, or else to fly off from any other
  floating body, whereas that side only, against which the water ascended,
  was thereby able to attract.</p>

  <p>It remains only, that I should determine how high the Water or other
  Liquor may by this means be raised in a smaller Pipe above the
  Superficies of that without it, and at what height it may be sustained:
  But to determine this, will be exceeding difficult, unless I could
  certainly know how much of the Airs pressure is taken off by the smalness
  of such and such a Pipe, and whether it may be wholly taken off, that is,
  whether there can be a hole or pore so small, into which Air could not at
  all enter, though water might with its whole force, for were there such,
  'tis manifest, that the water might rise in it to some five or six and
  thirty English Foot high. I know not whether the capillary Pipes in the
  bodies of small Trees, which we call their <i>Microscopical pores</i>,
  may not be such; and whether the congruity of the sides of the Pore may
  not yet draw the juyce even higher then the Air was
  able by its bare pressure to raise it: For, Congruity is a principle that
  not only unites and holds a body joyned to it, but, which is more,
  attracts and draws a body that is very near it, and holds it above its
  usual height.</p>

  <p>And this is obvious even in a drop of water suspended under any
  Similar or Congruous body: For, besides the ambient pressure that helps
  to keep it sustein'd, there is the Congruity of the bodies that are
  contiguous. This is yet more evident in Tenacious and Glutinous bodies;
  such as Gummous Liquors, Syrups, Pitch, and Rosin melted, <i>&amp;c.</i>
  Tar, Turpentine, Balsom, Bird-lime, <i>&amp;c.</i> for there it is
  evident, that the Parts of the tenacious body, as I may so call it, do
  stick and adhere so closely together, that though drawn out into long and
  very slender Cylinders, yet they will not easily relinquish one another;
  and this, though the bodies be <i>aliquatenus</i> fluid, and in motion by
  one another, which, to such as consider a fluid body only as its parts
  are in a confused irregular motion, without taking in also the congruity
  of the parts one among another, and incongruity to some other bodies,
  does appear not a little strange. So that besides the incongruity of the
  ambient fluid to it, we are to consider also the congruity of the parts
  of the contein'd fluid one with another.</p>

  <p>And this Congruity (that I may here a little further explain it) is
  both a Tenaceous and an Attractive power; for the Congruity, in the
  Vibrative motions, may be the cause of all kind of attraction, not only
  Electrical, but Magnetical also, and therefore it may be also of Tenacity
  and Glutinousness. For, from a perfect congruity of the motions of two
  distant bodies, the intermediate fluid particles are separated and droven
  away from between them, and thereby those congruous bodies are, by the
  incompassing mediums, compell'd and forced neerer together; wherefore
  that attractiveness must needs be stronger, when, by an immediate
  contact, they are forc'd to be exactly the same: As I shew more at large
  in my <i>Theory</i> of the <i>Magnet</i>. And this hints to me the reason
  of the suspension of the <i>Mercury</i> many inches, nay many feet, above
  the usual station of 30 inches. For the parts of <i>Quick-Silver,</i>
  being so very similar and congruous to each other, if once united, will
  not easily suffer a divulsion: And the parts of water, that were any
  wayes <i>heterogeneous</i>, being by <i>exantlation</i> or rarefaction
  exhausted, the remaining parts being also very similar, will not easily
  part neither. And the parts of the Glass being solid, are more
  difficultly disjoyn'd; and the water, being somewhat similar to both, is,
  as it were, a medium to unite both the <i>Glass</i> and the
  <i>Mercury</i> together. So that all three being united, and not very
  dissimilar, by means of this contact, if care be taken that the Tube in
  erecting be not shogged, the <i>Quicksilver</i> will remain suspended,
  notwithstanding its contrary indeavour of Gravity, a great height above
  its ordinary Station; but if this immediate Contact be removed, either by
  a meer separation of them one from another by the force of a shog,
  whereby the other becomes imbodied between them, and licks up from the
  surface some agil parts, and so hurling them makes them air, or else
  by some small heterogeneous agil part of the
  Water, or Air, or Quicksilver, which appears like a bubble, and by its
  jumbling to and fro there is made way for the <i>heterogeneous Æther</i>
  to obtrude it self between the Glass and either of the other Fluids, the
  Gravity of <i>Mercury precipitates</i> it downward with very great
  violence; and if the Vessel that holds the restagnating <i>Mercury</i> be
  convenient, the <i>Mercury</i> will for a time <i>vibrate</i> to and fro
  with very large <i>reciprocations</i>, and at last will remain kept up by
  the pressure of the external Air at the height of neer thirty inches. And
  whereas it may be objected, that it cannot be, that the meer imbodying of
  the <i>Æther</i> between these bodies can be the cause, since the
  <i>Æther</i> having a free passage alwayes, both through the Pores of the
  Glass, and through those of the Fluids, there is no reason why it should
  not make a separation at all times whilst it remains suspended, as when
  it is violently dis-joyned by a shog. To this I answer, That though the
  <i>Æther</i> passes between the Particles, that is, through the Pores of
  bodies, so as that any chasme or separation being made, it has infinite
  passages to admit its entry into it, yet such is the tenacity or
  attractive virtue of Congruity, that till it be overcome by the meer
  strength of Gravity, or by a shog assisting that Conatus of Gravity, or
  by an agil Particle, that is like a leaver agitated by the <i>Æther</i>;
  and thereby the parts of the congruous substances are separated so far
  asunder, that the strength of congruity is so far weakened, as not to be
  able to reunite them, the parts to be taken hold of being removed out of
  the attractive Sphere, as I may so speak, of the congruity; such, I say,
  is the tenacity of congruity, that it retains and holds the almost
  contiguous Particles of the Fluid, and suffers them not to be separated,
  till by meer force that attractive or retentive faculty be overcome: But
  the separation being once made beyond the Sphere of the attractive
  activity of congruity, that virtue becomes of no effect at all, but the
  <i>Mercury</i> freely falls downwards till it meet with a resistance from
  the pressure of the <i>ambient</i> Air, able to resist its gravity, and
  keep it forced up in the Pipe to the height of about thirty inches.</p>

  <p>Thus have I gently raised a Steel <i>pendulum</i> by a Loadstone to a
  great Angle, till by the shaking of my hand I have chanced to make a
  separation between them, which is no sooner made, but as if the Loadstone
  had retained no attractive virtue, the <i>Pendulum</i> moves freely from
  it towards the other side. So vast a difference is there between the
  attractive virtue of the <i>Magnet</i> when it acts upon a contiguous and
  upon a disjoyned body: and much more must there be between the attractive
  virtues of congruity upon a contiguous and disjoyned body; and in truth
  the attractive virtue is so little upon a body disjoyned, that though I
  have with a <i>Microscope</i> observed very diligently, whether there
  were any extraordinary <i>protuberance</i> on the side of a drop of water
  that was exceeding neer to the end of a green stick, but did not touch
  it, I could not perceive the least; though I found, that as soon as ever
  it toucht it the whole drop would presently unite it self with it; so
  that it seems an absolute contact is requisite to the exercising of the
  tenacious faculty of congruity.</p>

<hr class="full" />

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsVII" id="obsVII">VII</a>. <i>Of some </i>Phænomena<i> of Glass drops.</i></h3>

  <p>These <i>Glass Drops</i> are small parcels of coarse green Glass taken
  out of the Pots that contain the <i>Metal</i> (as they call it) in
  fusion, upon the end of an Iron Pipe; and being exceeding hot, and
  thereby of a kind of sluggish fluid Confidence, are suffered to drop from
  thence into a Bucket of cold Water, and in it to lye till they be grown
  sensibly cold.</p>

  <p>Some of these I broke in the open air, by snapping off a little of the
  small stem with my fingers, others by crushing it with a small pair of
  Plyers; which I had no sooner done, then the whole bulk of the drop flew
  violently, with a very brisk noise, into multitudes of small pieces, some
  of which were as small as dust, though in some there were remaining
  pieces pretty large, without any flaw at all, and others very much
  flaw'd, which by rubbing between ones fingers was easily reduced to dust;
  these dispersed every way so violently, that some of them pierced my
  skin. I could not find either with my naked Eye, or a <i>Microscope</i>,
  that any of the broken pieces were of a regular figure, nor any one like
  another, but for the most part those that flaw'd off in large pieces were
  prettily branched.</p>

  <p>The ends of others of these drops I nipt off whilst all the bodies and
  ends of them lay buried under the water, which, like the former, flew all
  to pieces with as brisk a noise, and as strong a motion.</p>

  <p>Others of these I tried to break, by grinding away the blunt end, and
  though I took a seemingly good one, and had ground away neer two thirds
  of the Ball, yet would it not fly to pieces, but now and then some small
  rings of it would snap and fly off, not without a brisk noise and quick
  motion, leaving the Surface of the drop whence it flew very prettily
  branched or creased, which was easily discoverable by the
  <i>Microscope</i>. This drop, after I had thus ground it, without at all
  impairing the remnant that was not ground away, I caused to fly
  immediately all into sand upon the nipping off the very tip of its
  slender end.</p>

  <p>Another of these drops I began to grind away at the smaller end, but
  had not worn away on the stone above a quarter of an inch before the
  whole drop flew with a brisk crack into sand or small dust; nor would it
  have held so long, had there not been a little flaw in the piece that I
  ground away, as I afterwards found.</p>

  <p>Several others of these drops I covered over with a thin but very tuff
  skin of <i>Icthyocolla</i>, which being very tough and very transparent,
  was the most convenient substance for these tryals that I could imagine,
  having dipt, I say, several of these drops in this transparent Glue
  whilst hot, and suffering them to hang by a string tied about the end of
  them till they were cold, and the skin pretty tough; then wrapping all
  the body of the drop (leaving out only the very tip) in fine
  supple Kids-leather very closely, I nipped off the small top, and found,
  as I expected, that notwithstanding this skin of Glue, and the close
  wrapping up in Leather, upon the breaking of the top, the drop gave a
  crack like the rest, and gave my hand a pretty brisk impulse: but yet the
  skin and leather was so strong as to keep the parts from flying out of
  their former posture; and, the skin being transparent, I found that the
  drop retained exactly its former figure and polish, but was grown
  perfectly opacous and all over flaw'd, all those flaws lying in the
  manner of rings, from the bottom or blunt end, to the very top or small
  point. And by several examinations with a <i>Microscope</i>, of several
  thus broken, I found the flaws, both within the body of the drop, and on
  the outward surface, to lye much in this order.</p>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-04.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 4.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> X.
</span>
  <p>Let AB in the Figure X of the fourth Scheme represent the drop cased
  over with <i>Icthyocolla</i> or <i>Isinglass</i>, (by being ordered as is
  before prescribed) crazed or flawed into pieces, but by the skin or case
  kept in its former figure, and each of its flawed parts preserved exactly
  in its due posture; the outward appearance of it somewhat plainly to the
  naked eye, but much more conspicuous if viewed with a small lens appeared
  much after this shape. That is, the blunt end B for a pretty breadth,
  namely, as far as the Ring CCC seemed irregularly flawed with divers
  clefts, which all seemed to tend towards the Center of it, being, as I
  afterwards found, and shall anon shew in the description of the figure Y,
  the Basis, as it were, of a Cone, which was terminated a little above the
  middle of the drop, all the rest of the Surface from CCC to A was flawed
  with an infinite number of small and parallel Rings, which as they were
  for the most part very round, so were they very thick and close together,
  but were not so exactly flaw'd as to make a perfect Ring, but each
  circular part was by irregular cracks flawed likewise into multitudes of
  irregular flakes or tiles; and this order was observed likewise the whole
  length of the neck.</p>

  <p>Now though I could not so exactly cut this <i>conical Body</i> through
  the <i>Axis</i>, as is represented by the figure Y; yet by
  <i>anatomizing</i>, as it were, of several, and taking notice of divers
  particular circumstances, I was informed, that could I have artificially
  divided a flaw'd drop through the <i>Axis</i> or <i>Center</i>, I should
  with a <i>Microscope</i> have found it to appear much of this form, where
  A signifies the <i>Apex</i>, and B the blunt end, CC the Cone of the
  Basis, which is terminated at T the top or end of it, which seems to be
  the very middle of the blunt end in which, not only the conical body of
  the Basis CC is terminated, but as many of the parts of the drop as reach
  as high as DD.</p>

  <p>And it seemed to be the head or beginning of a Pith, as it were, or a
  part of the body which seemed more spungy then the rest, and much more
  irregularly flawed, which from T ascended by EE, though less visible,
  into the small neck towards A. The Grain, as it were, of all the flaws,
  that proceeds from all the outward Surface ADCCDA, was much the same, as
  is represented by the black strokes that meet in the middle DT, DT, DE,
  DE, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>Nor is this kind of Grain, as I may call it, peculiar to Glass drops
  thus quenched; for (not to mention <i>Coperas-stones</i>, and divers
  other <i>Marchasites</i> and <i>Minerals</i>, which I have often taken
  notice of to be in the very same manner flaked or grained, with a kind of
  Pith in the middle) I have observed the same in all manner of cast Iron,
  especially the coarser sort, such as Stoves, and Furnaces, and Backs, and
  Pots are made of: For upon the breaking of any of those Substances it is
  obvious to observe, how from the out-sides towards the middle, there is a
  kind of Radiation or Grain much resembling this of the Glass-drop; but
  this Grain is most conspicuous in Iron-bullets, if they be broken: the
  same <i>Phænomena</i> may be produced by casting <i>regulus</i> of
  <i>Antimony</i> into a Bullet-mold, as also with <i>Glass of
  Antimony</i>, or with almost any such kind of <i>Vitrified substance</i>,
  either cast into a cold Mold or poured into Water.</p>

  <p>Others of these Drops I heat red hot in the fire, and then suffered
  them to cool by degrees. And these I found to have quite lost all their
  <i>fulminating</i> or flying quality, as also their hard, brittle and
  springy texture; and to emerge of a much softer temper, and much easier
  to be broken or snapt with ones finger; but its strong and brittle
  quality was quite destroyed, and it seemed much of the same consistence
  with other green Glass well nealed in the Oven.</p>

  <p>The Figure and bigness of these for the most part was the same with
  that of the Figure Z; that is, all the surface of them was very smooth
  and polisht, and for the most part round, but very rugged or knobbed
  about D, and all the length of the stem was here and there pitted or
  flatted. About D, which is at the upper part of the drop under that side
  of the stem which is concave, there usually was made some one or more
  little Hillocks or Prominences. The drop it self, before it be broken,
  appears very transparent, and towards the middle of it, to be very full
  of small Bubbles, of some kind of aerial substance, which by the
  refraction of the outward surface appear much bigger then really they
  are, and this may be in good part removed, by putting the drop under the
  surface of clear Water, for by that means most part of the refraction of
  the convex Surface of the drop is destroyed, and the bubbles will appear
  much smaller. And this, by the by, minds me of the appearing magnitude of
  the <i>aperture</i> of the <i>iris</i>, or <i>pupil</i> of the eye, which
  though it appear, and be therefore judged very large, is yet not above a
  quarter of the bigness it appears of, by the <i>lenticular</i> refraction
  of the <i>Cornea</i>.</p>

  <p>The cause of all which <i>Phænomena</i> I imagine to be no other then
  this, That the Parts of the Glass being by the excessive heat of the fire
  kept off and separated one from another, and thereby put into a kind of
  sluggish fluid consistence, are suffered to drop off with that heat or
  agitation remaining in them, into cold Water; by which means the outsides
  of the drop are presently cool'd and <i>crusted</i>, and are thereby made
  of a loose texture, because the parts of it have not time to settle
  themselves leisurely together, and so to lie very close together: And the
  innermost parts of the drop, retaining still much of their former heat
  and agitations, remain of a loose texture also, and,
  according as the cold strikes inwards from the bottom and sides, are
  quenched, as it were, and made rigid in that very posture wherein the
  cold finds them. For the parts of the <i>crust</i> being already
  hardened, will not suffer the parts to shrink any more from the outward
  Surface inward; and though it shrink a little by reason of the small
  parcels of some Aerial substances dispersed through the matter of the
  Glass, yet that is not neer so much as it appears (as I just now hinted;)
  nor if it were, would it be sufficient for to consolidate and condense
  the body of Glass into a <i>tuff</i> and close <i>texture</i>, after it
  had been so excessively rarified by the heat of the glass-Furnace.</p>

  <p>But that there may be such an expansion of the aerial substance
  contained in those little <i>blebbs</i> or bubbles in the body of the
  drop, this following Experiment will make more evident.</p>

  <br clear="all" />
<hr />

  <p>Take a small Glass-Cane about a foot long, seal up one end of it
  <i>hermetically</i>, then put in a very small bubble of Glass, almost of
  the shape of an Essence-viol with the open mouth towards the sealed end,
  then draw out the other end of the Pipe very small, and fill the whole
  Cylinder with water, then set this Tube by the Fire till the Water begin
  to boyl, and the Air in the bubble be in good part rarified and driven
  out, then by sucking at the smalling Pipe, more of the Air or vapours in
  the bubble may be suck'd out, so that it may sink to the bottom; when it
  is sunk to the bottom, in the flame of a Candle, or Lamp, nip up the
  slender Pipe and let it cool: whereupon it is obvious to observe, first,
  that the Water by degrees will subside and shrink into much less room:
  Next, that the Air or vapours in the Glass will expand themselves so, as
  to buoy up the little Glass: Thirdly, that all about the inside of the
  Glass-pipe there will appear an infinite number of small bubbles, which
  as the Water grows colder and colder will swell bigger and bigger, and
  many of them buoy themselves up and break at the top.</p>

  <p>From this <i>Disceding</i> of the heat in Glass drops, that is, by the
  quenching or cooling Irradiations propagated from the Surface upwards and
  inwards, by the lines CT, CT, DT, DE, <i>&amp;c.</i> the bubbles in the
  drop have room to expand themselves a little, and the parts of the Glass
  contract themselves; but this operation being too quick for the sluggish
  parts of the Glass, the contraction is performed very unequally and
  irregularly, and thereby the Particles of the Glass are bent, some one
  way, and some another, yet so as that most of them draw towards the Pith
  or middle TEEE, or rather from that outward: so that they cannot
  <i>extricate</i> or unbend themselves, till some part of TEEE be broken
  and loosened, for all the parts about that are placed in the manner of an
  Arch, and so till their hold at TEEE be loosened they cannot fly asunder,
  but uphold, and shelter, and fix each other much like the stones in a
  Vault, where each stone does concurre to the stability of the whole
  Fabrick, and no one stone can be taken away but the whole Arch falls. And
  wheresoever any of those radiating wedges DTD, &amp;c. are removed, which
  are the component parts of this Arch, the whole Fabrick presently falls
  to pieces; for all the Springs of the several
  parts are set at liberty, which immediately extricate themselves and fly
  asunder every way; each part by its spring contributing to the darting of
  it self and some other contiguous part. But if this drop be heat so hot
  as that the parts by degrees can unbend themselves, and be settled and
  annealed in that posture, and be then suffered gently to subside and
  cool; The parts by this nealing losing their springiness, constitute a
  drop of a more soft but less brittle texture, and the parts being not at
  all under a flexure, though any part of the middle or Pith TEEE be
  broken, yet will not the drop at all fly to pieces as before.</p>

  <p>This Conjecture of mine I shall indeavour to make out by explaining
  each particular Assertion with <i>analogous</i> Experiments: The
  Assertions are there.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, That the parts of the Glass, whilst in a fluid Consistence and
  hot, are more rarified, or take up more room, then when hard and
  cold.</p>

  <p>Secondly, That the parts of the drop do suffer a twofold
  contraction.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, That the dropping or quenching the glowing metal in the Water
  makes it of a hard, springing, and rarified texture.</p>

  <p>Fourthly, That there is a flexion or force remaining upon the parts of
  the Glass thus quenched, from which they indeavour to extricate
  themselves.</p>

  <p>Fifthly, That the Fabrick of the drop, that is able to hinder the
  parts from extricating themselves, is <i>analogus</i> to that of an
  Arch.</p>

  <p>Sixthly, That the sudden flying asunder of the parts proceeds from
  their springiness.</p>

  <p>Seventhly, That a gradual heating and cooling does anneal or reduce
  the parts of Glass to a texture that is more loose, and easilier to be
  broken, but not so brittle.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>That the first of these is true may be gathered from this, That
  <i>Heat is a property of a body arising from the motion or agitation of
  its parts</i>; and therefore whatever body is thereby toucht must
  necessarily receive some part of that motion, whereby its parts will be
  shaken and agitated, and so by degrees free and extricate themselves from
  one another, and each part so moved does by that motion <i>exert</i> a
  <i>conatus</i> of <i>protruding</i> and displacing all the adjacent
  Particles. Thus Air included in a vessel, by being heated will burst it
  to pieces. Thus have I broke a Bladder held over the fire in my hand,
  with such a violence and noise, that it almost made me deaf for the
  present, and much surpassed the noise of a Musket: The like have I done
  by throwing into the fire small glass Bubbles hermetically sealed, with a
  little drop of Water included in them. Thus Water also, or any other
  Liquor, included in a convenient vessel, by being warmed, manifestly
  expands it self with a very great violence, so as to break the strongest
  vessel, if when heated it be narrowly imprisoned in it.
  This is very manifest by the <i>Sealed Thermometers</i>, which I have, by
  several tryals, at last brought to a great certainty and tenderness: for
  I have made some with stems above four foot long, in which the expanding
  Liquor would so far vary, as to be very neer the very top in the heat of
  Summer, and prety neer the bottom at the coldest time of the Winter. The
  Stems I use for them are very thick, straight, and even Pipes of Glass,
  with a very small <i>perforation</i>, and both the head and body I have
  made on purpose at the Glass-house, of the same metal whereof the Pipes
  are drawn: these I can easily in the flame of a Lamp, urged with the
  blast of a pair of Bellows, seal and close together, so as to remain very
  firm, close and even; by this means I joyn on the body first, and then
  fill both it and a part of the stem, proportionate to the length of the
  stem and the warmth of the season I fill it in with the best rectified
  <i>Spirit of Wine</i> highly <i>ting'd</i> with the lovely colour of
  <i>Cocheneel</i>, which I deepen the more by pouring some drops of common
  <i>Spirit of Urine</i>, which must not be too well rectified, because it
  will be apt to make the Liquor to curdle and stick in the small
  perforation of the stem. This Liquor I have upon tryal found the most
  tender of any spirituous Liquor, and those are much more sensibly
  affected with the variations of heat and cold then other more flegmatick
  and ponderous Liquors, and as capable of receiving a deep tincture, and
  keeping it, as any Liquor whatsoever; and (which makes it yet more
  acceptable) is not subject to be frozen by any cold yet known. When I
  have thus filled it, I can very easily in the forementioned flame of a
  Lamp seal and joyn on the head of it.</p>

  <p>Then, for graduating the stem, I fix that for the beginning of my
  division where the surface of the liquor in the stem remains when the
  ball is placed in common distilled water, that is so cold that it just
  begins to freeze and shoot into flakes; and that mark I fix at a
  convenient place of the stem, to make it capable of exhibiting very many
  degrees of cold, below that which is requisite to freeze water: the rest
  of my divisions, both above and below this (which I mark with a [0] or
  nought) I place according to the Degrees of <i>Expansion</i>, or
  <i>Contraction</i> of the Liquor in proportion to the bulk it had when it
  indur'd the newly mention'd freezing cold. And this may be very easily
  and accurately enough done by this following way; Prepare a Cylindrical
  vessel of very thin plate Brass or Silver, ABCD of the figure Z; the
  Diameter AB of whose cavity let be about two inches, and the depth BC the
  same; let each end be cover'd with a flat and smooth plate of the same
  substance, closely soder'd on, and in the midst of the upper cover make a
  pretty large hole EF, about the bigness of a fifth part of the Diameter
  of the other; into this fasten very well with cement a straight and even
  Cylindrical pipe of Glass, EFGH, the Diameter of whose cavity let be
  exactly one tenth of the Diameter of the greater Cylinder. Let this pipe
  be mark'd at GH with a Diamant, so that G from E may be distant just two
  inches, or the same height with that of the cavity of the greater
  Cylinder, then divide the length EG exactly into 10 parts, so the
  capacity of the hollow of each of these divisions will be 1/1000 part of
  the capacity of the greater Cylinder. This vessel
  being thus prepared, the way of marking and graduating the
  <i>Thermometers</i> may be very easily thus performed:</p>

  <p>Fill this Cylindrical vessel with the same liquor wherewith the
  <i>Thermometers</i> are fill'd, then place both it and the
  <i>Thermometer</i> you are to <i>graduate</i>, in water that is ready to
  be frozen, and bring the surface of the liquor in the <i>Thermometer</i>
  to the first marke or [0]; then so proportion the liquor in the
  Cylindrical vessel, that the surface of it may just be at the lower end
  of the small glass-Cylinder; then very gently and gradually warm the
  water in which both the <i>Thermometer</i> and this Cylindrical vessel
  stand, and as you perceive the ting'd liquor to rise in both stems, with
  the point of a Diamond give several marks on the stem of the
  <i>Thermometer</i> at those places, which by comparing the expansion in
  both Stems, are found to correspond to the divisions of the cylindrical
  vessel, and having by this means marked some few of these divisions on
  the Stem, it will be very easie by these to mark all the rest of the
  Stem, and accordingly to assign to every division a proper character.</p>

  <p>A <i>Thermometer</i>, thus marked and prepared, will be the fittest
  Instrument to make a Standard of heat and cold that can be imagined. For
  being sealed up, it is not at all subject to variation or wasting, nor is
  it liable to be changed by the varying pressure of the Air, which all
  other kind of <i>Thermometers</i> that are open to the Air are liable to.
  But to proceed.</p>

  <p>This property of Expansion with Heat, and Contraction with Cold, is
  not peculiar to Liquors only, but to all kind of solid Bodies also,
  especially Metals, which will more manifestly appear by this
  Experiment.</p>

  <p>Take the Barrel of a Stopcock of Brass, and let the Key, which is well
  fitted to it, be riveted into it, so that it may slip, and be easily
  turned round, then heat this Cock in the fire, and you will find the Key
  so swollen, that you will not be able to turn it round in the Barrel; but
  if it be suffered to cool again, as soon as it is cold it will be as
  movable, and as easie to be turned as before.</p>

  <p>This Quality is also very observable in <i>Lead</i>, <i>Tin</i>,
  <i>Silver</i>, <i>Antimony</i>, <i>Pitch</i>, <i>Rosin</i>,
  <i>Bees-wax</i>, <i>Butter</i>, and the like; all which, if after they be
  melted you suffer gently to cool, you shall find the parts of the upper
  Surface to subside and fall inwards, losing that plumpness and smoothness
  it had whilst in fusion. The like I have also observed in the cooling of
  <i>Glass of Antimony</i>, which does very neer approach the nature of
  Glass,</p>

  <p>But because these are all Examples taken from other materials then
  Glass, and argue only, that possibly there may be the like property also
  in Glass, not that really there is; we shall by three or four Experiments
  indeavour to manifest that also.</p>

  <p>And the First is an Observation that is very obvious even in these
  very drops, to wit, that they are all of them terminated with an unequal
  or irregular Surface, especially about the smaller part of the drop, and
  the whole length of the stem; as about D, and from thence to A, the whole
  Surface, which would have been round if the drop had cool'd leisurely,
  is, by being quenched hastily, very irregularly flatted and pitted; which
  I suppose proceeds partly from the Waters
  unequally cooling and pressing the parts of the drop, and partly from the
  self-contracting or subsiding quality of the substance of the Glass: For
  the vehemency of the heat of the drop causes such hidden motions and
  bubbles in the cold Water, that some parts of the Water bear more
  forcibly against one part then against another, and consequently do more
  suddenly cool those parts to which they are contiguous.</p>

  <p>A Second Argument may be drawn from the Experiment of cutting Glasses
  with a hot Iron. For in that Experiment the top of the Iron heats, and
  thereby rarifies the parts of the Glass that lie just before the crack,
  whence each of those agitated parts indeavouring to expand its self and
  get elbow-room, thrusts off all the rest of the contiguous parts, and
  consequently promotes the crack that was before begun.</p>

  <p>A Third Argument may be drawn from the way of producing a crack in a
  sound piece or plate of Glass, which is done two wayes, either First, by
  suddenly heating a piece of Glass in one place more then in another. And
  by this means <i>chymists</i> usually cut off the necks of Glass-bodies,
  by two kinds of Instruments, either by a glowing hot round Iron-Ring,
  which just incompasses the place that is to be cut, or else by a
  <i>Sulphur'd</i> Threed, which is often wound about the place where the
  separation is to be made, and then fired. Or Secondly, A Glass may be
  cracked by cooling it suddenly in any place with Water, or the like,
  after it has been all leisurely and gradually heated very hot. Both which
  <i>Phænomena</i> seem manifestly to proceed from the <i>expansion</i> and
  contraction of the parts of the Glass, which is also made more probable
  by this circumstance which I have observed, that a piece of common
  window-glass being heated in the middle very suddenly with a live Coal or
  hot Iron, does usually at the first crack fall into pieces, whereas if
  the Plate has been gradually heated very hot, and a drop of cold Water
  and the like be put on the middle of it, it only flaws it, but does not
  break it asunder immediately.</p>

  <p>A Fourth Argument may be drawn from this Experiment; Take a
  Glass-pipe, and fit into a solid stick of Glass, so as it will but just
  be moved in it. Then by degrees heat them whilst they are one within
  another, and they will grow stiffer, but when they are again cold, they
  will be as easie to be turned as before. This Expansion of Glass is more
  manifest in this Experiment.</p>

  <p>Take a stick of Glass of a considerable length, and fit it so between
  the two ends or screws of a Lath, that it may but just easily turn, and
  that the very ends of it may be just toucht and susteined thereby; then
  applying the flame of the Candle to the middle of it, and heating it hot,
  you will presently find the Glass to stick very fast on those points, and
  not without much difficulty to be convertible on them, before that by
  removing the flame for a while from it, it be suffered to cool, and when
  you will find it as easie to be turned round as at the first.</p>

  <p>From all which Experiments it is very evident, that all those Bodies,
  and particularly Glass, suffers an Expansion by Heat, and that a very
  considerable one, whilst they are in a state of Fusion.
  For <i>Fluidity</i>, as I elsewhere mention, <i>being nothing but an
  effect of very strong and quick shaking motion, whereby the parts are, as
  it were, loosened from each other, and consequently leave an interjacent
  space or vacuity</i>; it follows, that all those shaken Particles must
  necessarily take up much more room then when they were at rest, and lay
  quietly upon each other. And this is further confirmed by a Pot of
  <i>boyling Alabaster</i>, which will manifestly rise a sixth or eighth
  part higher in the Pot, whilst it is boyling, then it will remain at,
  both before and after it be boyled. The reason of which odd
  <i>Phænomenon</i> (to hint it here only by the way) is this, that there
  is in the curious powder of Alabaster, and other calcining Stones, a
  certain watery substance, which is so fixt and included with the solid
  Particles, that till the heat be very considerable they will not fly
  away; but after the heat is increased to such a degree, they break out
  every way in vapours, and thereby so shake and loosen the small corpusles
  of the Powder from each other, that they become perfectly of the nature
  of a fluid body, and one may move a stick to and fro through it, and stir
  it as easily as water, and the vapours burst and break out in bubbles
  just as in boyling water, and the like; whereas, both before those watery
  parts are flying away, and after they are quite gone; that is, before and
  after it have done boyling, all those effects cease, and a stick is as
  difficultly moved to and fro in it as in sand, or the like. Which
  Explication I could easily prove, had I time; but this is not a fit place
  for it.</p>

  <p>To proceed therefore, I say, that the dropping of this expanded Body
  into cold Water, does make the parts of the Glass suffer a double
  contraction: The first is, of those parts which are neer the Surface of
  the Drop. For Cold, as I said before, contracting Bodies, that is, <i>by
  the abatement of the agitating faculty the parts falling neerer
  together</i>; the parts next adjoyning to the Water must needs lose much
  of their motion, and impart it to the Ambient-water (which the Ebullition
  and commotion of it manifests) and thereby become a solid and hard crust,
  whilst the innermost parts remain yet fluid and expanded; whence, as they
  grow cold also by degrees, their parts must necessarily be left at
  liberty to be condensed, but because of the hardness of the outward
  crust, the contraction cannot be admitted that way; but there being many
  very small, and before inconspicuous, bubbles in the substance of the
  Glass, upon the subsiding of the parts of the Glass, the agil substance
  contained in them has liberty of expanding it self a little, and thereby
  those bubbles grow much bigger, which is the second Contraction. And both
  these are confirmed from the appearance of the Drop it self: for as for
  the outward parts, we see, first, that it is irregular and shrunk, as it
  were, which is caused by the yielding a little of the hardened Skin to a
  Contraction, after the very outmost Surface is settled; and as for the
  internal parts, one may with ones naked Eye perceive abundance of very
  conspicuous bubbles, and with the <i>Microscope</i> many more.</p>

  <p>The Consideration of which Particulars will easily make the Third
  Position probable, that is, that the parts of the drop will be of a very
  hard, though of a rarified Texture; for if the outward parts of the Drop,
  by reason of its hard crust, will indure very little Contraction, and the
  agil Particles, included in those bubbles, by the losing
  of their agitation, by the decrease of the Heat, lose also most part of
  their Spring and Expansive power; it follows (the withdrawing of the heat
  being very sudden) that the parts must be left in a very loose Texture,
  and by reason of the implication of the parts one about another, which
  from their sluggishnes and glutinousness I suppose to be much after the
  manner of the sticks in a Thorn-bush, or a Lock of Wool; it will follow,
  I say, that the parts will hold each other very strongly together, and
  indeavour to draw each other neerer together, and consequently their
  Texture must be very hard and stiff, but very much rarified.</p>

  <p>And this will make probable my next Position, That <i>the parts of the
  Glass are under a kind of tension or flexure, out of which they indeavour
  to extricate and free themselves</i>, and thereby all the parts draw
  towards the Center or middle, and would, if the outward parts would give
  way, as they do when the outward parts cool leisurely (as in baking of
  Glasses) contract the bulk of the drop into a much less compass. For
  since, as I proved before, the Internal parts of the drop, when fluid,
  were of a very rarified Texture, and, as it were, tos'd open like a Lock
  of Wool, and if they were suffered leisurely to cool, would be again
  prest, as it were, close together: And since that the heat, which kept
  them bended and open, is removed, and yet the parts not suffered to get
  as neer together as they naturally would; It follows, that the Particles
  remain under a kind of <i>tension</i> and <i>flexure</i>, and
  consequently have an indeavour to free themselves from that
  <i>bending</i> and <i>distension</i>, which they do, as soon as either
  the tip be broken, or as soon as by a leisurely heating and cooling, the
  parts are nealed into another posture.</p>

  <p>And this will make my next Position probable, that <i>the parts of the
  Glass drops are contignated together in the form of an Arch</i>, cannot
  any where yield or be drawn inwards, till by the removing of some one
  part of it (as it happens in the removing one of the stones of an Arch)
  the whole Fabrick is shatter'd, and falls to pieces, and each of the
  Springs is left at liberty, suddenly to extricate it self: for since I
  have made it probable, that the internal parts of the Glass have a
  contractive power inwards, and the external parts are incapable of such a
  Contraction, and the figure of it being spherical; it follows, that the
  superficial parts must bear against each other, and keep one another from
  being condens'd into a less room, in the same manner as the stones of an
  Arch conduce to the upholding each other in that Figure. And this is made
  more probable by another Experiment which was communicated to me by an
  excellent Person, whose extraordinary Abilities in all kind of Knowledg,
  especially in that of Natural things, and his generous Disposition in
  communicating, incouraged me to have recourse to him on many occasions.
  The Experiment was this: Small Glass-balls (about the bigness of that
  represented in the <i>Figure &amp;.</i>) would, upon rubbing or
  scratching the inward Surface, fly all insunder, with a pretty brisk
  noise; whereas neither before nor after the inner Surface had been thus
  scratcht, did there appear any flaw or crack. And putting the pieces of
  one of those broken ones together again, the flaws appeared much after
  the manner of the black lines on the Figure, <i>&amp;.</i> These Balls
  were small, but exceeding thick bubbles of Glass, which being crack'd off
  from the <i>Puntilion</i> whilst very hot, and so suffered to cool
  without nealing them in the Oven over the Furnace, do
  thereby (being made of white Glass, which cools much quicker then green
  Glass, and is thereby made much brittler) acquire a very <i>porous</i>
  and very brittle <i>texture</i>: so that if with the point of a Needle or
  Bodkin, the inside of any of them be rubbed prety hard, and then laid on
  a Table, it will, within a very little while, break into many pieces with
  a brisk noise, and throw the parts above a span asunder on the Table: Now
  though the pieces are not so small as those of a <i>fulminating</i> drop,
  yet they as plainly shew, that the outward parts of the Glass have a
  great <i>Conatus</i> to fly asunder, were they not held together by the
  <i>tenacity</i> of the parts of the inward Surface: for we see as soon as
  those parts are crazed by hard rubbing, and thereby their tenacity
  spoiled, the springiness of the more outward parts quickly makes a
  divulsion, and the broken pieces will, if the concave Surface of them be
  further scratcht with a Diamond, fly again into smaller pieces.</p>

  <p>From which preceding considerations it will follow Sixthly, That the
  sudden flying asunder of the parts as soon as this Arch is any where
  disordered or broken, proceeds from the springing of the parts; which,
  indeavouring to <i>extricate</i> themselves as soon as they get the
  liberty, they perform it with such a quickness, that they throw one
  another away with very great violence: for the Particles that compose the
  Crust have a <i>Conatus</i> to lye further from one another, and
  therefore as soon as the external parts are loosened they dart themselves
  outward with great violence, just as so many Springs would do, if they
  were detained and fastened to the body, as soon as they should be
  suddenly loosened; and the internal parts drawing inward, they contract
  so violently; that they rebound back again and fly into multitude of
  small shivers or sands. Now though they appear not, either to the naked
  Eye, or the <i>Microscope</i>, yet I am very apt to think there may be
  abundance of small flaws or cracks, which, by reason the strong
  reflecting Air is not got between the <i>contiguous</i> parts, appear
  not. And that this may be so, I argue from this, that I have very often
  been able to make a crack or flaw, in some convenient pieces of Glass, to
  appear and disappear at pleasure, according as by pressing together, or
  pulling asunder the contiguous parts, I excluded or admitted the strong
  reflecting Air between the parts: And it is very probable, that there may
  be some Body, that is either very rarified Air, or something
  <i>analogous</i> to it, which fills the bubbles of these drops; which I
  argue, first, from the roundness of them, and next, from the vivid
  reflection of Light which they exhibite: Now though I doubt not, but that
  the Air in them is very much rarified, yet that there is some in them, to
  such as well consider this Experiment of the disappearing of a crack upon
  the <i>extruding</i> of the Air, I suppose it will seem more then
  probable.</p>

  <p>The Seventh and last therefore that I shall prove, is, <i>That the
  gradual heating and cooling of these so extended bodies does reduce the
  parts of the Glass to a looser and softer temper</i>. And this I found by
  heating them, and keeping them for a prety while very red hot in a fire;
  for thereby I found them to grow a little lighter, and the small Stems to
  be very easily broken and snapt any where, without at all making the drop
  fly; whereas before they were so exceeding hard, that they
  could not be broken without much difficulty; and upon their breaking the
  whole drop would fly in pieces with very great violence. The Reason of
  which last seems to be, that the leisurely heating and cooling of the
  parts does not only wast some part of the Glass it self, but ranges all
  the parts into a better order, and gives each Particle an opportunity of
  <i>relaxing</i> its self, and consequently neither will the parts hold so
  strongly together as before, nor be so difficult to be broken: The parts
  now more easily yielding, nor will the other parts fly in pieces, because
  the parts have no bended Springs. The <i>relaxation</i> also in the
  temper of hardned Steel, and hammered Metals, by nealing them in the
  fire, seems to proceed from much the same cause. For both by quenching
  suddenly such Metals as have <i>vitrifed</i> parts interspers'd, as Steel
  has, and by hammering of other kinds that do not so much abound with
  them, as Silver Brass, <i>&amp;c.</i> the parts are put into and detained
  in a bended posture, which by the agitation of Heat are shaken, and
  loosened, and suffered to unbend themselves.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsVIII" id="obsVIII">VIII</a>. <i>Of the fiery Sparks struck from a Flint or Steel.</i></h3>

  <p>It is a very common Experiment, by striking with a Flint against a
  Steel, to make certain fiery and shining Sparks to fly out from between
  those two compressing Bodies. About eight years since, upon casually
  reading the Explication of this odd <i>Phænomenon</i>, by the most
  Ingenious <i>Des Cartes</i>, I had a great desire to be satisfied, what
  that Substance was that gave such a shining and bright Light: And to that
  end I spread a sheet of white Paper, and on it, observing the place where
  several of these Sparks seemed to vanish, I found certain very small,
  black, but glittering Spots of a movable Substance, each of which
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-05.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 5.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 1.
</span>
  examining with my <i>Microscope</i>, I found to be a small round
  <i>Globule</i>; some of which, as they looked prety small, so did they
  from their Surface yield a very bright and strong reflection on that side
  which was next the Light; and each look'd almost like a prety bright
  Iron-Ball, whose Surface was prety regular, such as is represented by the
  Figure A. In this I could perceive the Image of the Window prety well, or
  of a Stick, which I moved up and down between the Light and it. Others I
  found, which were, as to the bulk of the Ball, prety regularly round, but
  the Surface of them, as it was not very smooth, but rough, and more
  irregular, so was the reflection from it more faint and confused. Such
  were the Surfaces of B. C. D. and E. Some of these I found cleft or
  cracked, as C, others quite broken in two and hollow, as D. which seemed
  to be half the hollow shell of a Granado, broken irregularly in pieces.
  Several others I found of other shapes; but that which is represented by
  E, I observed to be a very big Spark of fire, which went out upon one
  side of the Flint that I struck fire withall, to which it
  stuck by the root F, at the end of which small Stem was fastened-on a
  <i>Hemisphere</i>, or half a hollow Ball, with the mouth of it open from
  the stemwards, so that it looked much like a Funnel, or an old fashioned
  Bowl without a foot. This night, making many tryals and observations of
  this Experiment, I met, among a multitude of the Globular ones which I
  had observed, a couple of Instances, which are very remarkable to the
  confirmation of my <i>Hypothesis</i>.</p>

  <p>And the First was of a pretty big Ball fastened on to the end of a
  small sliver of Iron, which <i>Compositum</i> seemed to be nothing else
  but a long thin chip of Iron, one of whose ends was melted into a small
  round Globul; the other end remaining unmelted and irregular, and
  perfectly Iron.</p>

  <p>The Second Instance was not less remarkable then the First; for I
  found, when a Spark went out, nothing but a very small thin long sliver
  of Iron or Steel, unmelted at either end. So that it seems, that some of
  these Sparks are the slivers or chips of the Iron <i>vitrified</i>,
  Others are only the slivers melted into Balls without vitrification, And
  the third kind are only small slivers of the Iron, made red-hot with the
  violence of the stroke given on the Steel by the Flint.</p>

  <p>He that shall diligently examine the <i>Phænomena</i> of this
  Experiment, will, I doubt not, find cause to believe, that the reason I
  have heretofore given of it, is the true and genuine cause of it, namely,
  That <i>the Spark, appearing so bright in the falling, is nothing else
  but a small piece of the Steel or Flint, but most commonly of the Steel,
  which by the violence of the stroke is at the same time sever'd and heat
  red-hot, and that sometimes to such a degree, as to make it melt together
  into a small Globule of Steel; and sometimes also is that heat so very
  intense, as further to melt it and vitrifie it; but many times the heat
  is so gentle, as to be able to make the sliver only red hot, which
  notwithstanding falling upon the tinder</i> (that is only a very curious
  small Coal made of the small threads of Linnen burnt to coals and char'd)
  <i>it easily sets it on fire</i>. Nor will any part of this
  <i>Hypothesis</i> seem strange to him that considers, First, that either
  hammering, or filing or otherwise violently rubbing of Steel, will
  presently make it so hot as to be able to burn ones fingers. Next, that
  the whole force of the stroke is exerted upon that small part where the
  Flint and Steel first touch: For the Bodies being each of them so very
  hard, the puls cannot be far communicated, that is, the parts of each can
  yield but very little, and therefore the violence of the concussion will
  be <i>exerted</i> on that piece of Steel which is cut off by the Flint.
  Thirdly, that the filings or small parts of Steel are very apt, as it
  were, to take fire, and are presently red hot, that is, there seems to be
  a very <i>combustible sulphureous</i> Body in Iron or Steel, which the
  Air very readily preys upon, as soon as the body is a little violently
  heated.</p>

  <p>And this is obvious in the filings of Steel or Iron cast through the
  flame of a Candle; for even by that sudden <i>transitus</i> of the small
  chips of Iron, they are heat red hot, and that <i>combustible
  sulphureous</i> Body is presently prey'd upon and devoured by the
  <i>aereal</i> incompassing <i>Menstruum</i>, whose office in this
  Particular I have shewn in the Explication of Charcole.</p>

  <p>And in prosecution of this Experiment, having taken the filings of
  Iron and Steel, and with the point of a Knife cast them through the flame
  of a Candle, I observed where some conspicuous shining Particles fell,
  and looking on them with my <i>Microscope</i>, I found them to be nothing
  else but such round Globules, as I formerly found the Sparks struck from
  the Steel by a stroke to be, only a little bigger; and shaking together
  all the filings that had fallen upon the sheet of Paper underneath and
  observing them with the <i>Microscope</i>, I found a great number of
  small Globules, such as the former, though there were also many of the
  parts that had remained untoucht and rough filings or chips of Iron. So
  that, it seems, Iron does contain a very <i>combustible sulphureous</i>
  Body, which is, in all likelihood, one of the causes of this
  <i>Phænomenon</i>, and which may be perhaps very much concerned in the
  business of its hardening and tempering: of which somewhat it said in the
  Description of <i>Muscovy-glass</i>.</p>

  <p>So that, these things considered, we need not trouble our selves to
  find out what kind of Pores they are, both in the Flint and Steel, that
  contain the <i>Atoms of fire</i>, nor how those <i>Atoms</i> come to be
  hindred from running all out, when a dore or passage in their Pores is
  made by the concussion: nor need we trouble our selves to examine by what
  <i>Prometheus</i> the Element of Fire comes to be fetcht down from above
  the Regions of the Air, in what Cells or Boxes it is kept, and what
  <i>Epimetheus</i> lets it go: Nor to consider what it is that causes so
  great a conflux of the atomical Particles of Fire, which are said to fly
  to a flaming Body, like Vultures or Eagles to a putrifying Carcass, and
  there to make a very great pudder. Since we have nothing more difficult
  in this <i>Hypothesis</i> to conceive, first, as to the kindling of
  Tinder, then how a large Iron-bullet, let fall red or glowing hot upon a
  heap of Small-coal, should set fire to those that are next to it first:
  Nor secondly, is this last more difficult to be explicated, then that a
  Body, as Silver for Instance, put into a weak <i>Menstruum</i>, as
  unrectified <i>Aqua fortis</i> should, when it is put in a great heat, be
  there dissolved by it, and not before; which <i>Hypothesis</i> is more
  largely explicated in the Description of Charcoal. To conclude, we see by
  this Instance, how much Experiments may conduce to the regulating of
  <i>Philosophical notions</i>. For if the most Acute <i>Des Cartes</i> had
  applied himself experimentally to have examined what substance it was
  that caused that shining of the falling Sparks struck from a Flint and a
  Steel, he would certainly have a little altered his <i>Hypothesis</i>,
  and we should have found, that his Ingenious Principles would have
  admitted a very plausible Explication of this <i>Phænomenon</i>; whereas
  by not examining so far as he might, he has set down an Explication which
  Experiment do's contradict.</p>

  <p>But before I leave this Description, I must not forget to take notice
  of the Globular form into which each of these is most curiously formed.
  And this <i>Phænomenon</i>, as I have elsewhere more largely shewn,
  proceeds from a propriety which belongs to all kinds of fluid Bodies more
  or less, and is caused by the Incongruity of the Ambient and included
  Fluid, which so acts and modulates each other, that they acquire, as neer
  as is possible, a <i>spherical</i> or
  <i>globular</i> form, which propriety and several of the <i>Phænomena</i>
  that proceed from it, I have more fully explicated in the sixth
  Observation.</p>

  <p>One Experiment, which does very much illustrate my present
  Explication, and is in it self exceeding pretty, I must not pass by: And
  that is a way of making small <i>Globules</i> or <i>Balls</i> of Lead, or
  Tin, as small almost as these of Iron or Steel, and that exceeding easily
  and quickly, by turning the filings or chips of those Metals also into
  perfectly round <i>Globules</i>. The way, in short, as I received it from
  the <i>Learned Physitian Doctor</i> I.G. is this;</p>

  <p>Reduce the Metal you would thus shape, into exceeding fine filings,
  the finer the filings are, the finer will the Balls be: <i>Stratifie</i>
  these filings with the fine and well dryed powder of quick Lime in a
  <i>Crucible</i> proportioned to the quantity you intend to make: When you
  have thus filled your <i>Crucible</i>, by continual
  <i>stratifications</i> of the filings and powder, so that, as neer as may
  be, no one of the filings may touch another, place the <i>Crucible</i> in
  a <i>gradual fire</i>, and by degrees let it be brought to a heat big
  enough to make all the filings, that are mixt with the quick Lime, to
  melt, and no more; for if the fire be too hot, many of these filings will
  joyn and run together; whereas if the heat be proportioned, upon washing
  the Lime-dust in fair Water, all those small filings of the Metal will
  subside to the bottom in a most curious powder, consisting all of exactly
  round <i>Globules</i>, which, if it be very fine, is very excellent to
  make Hour-glasses of.</p>

  <p>Now though quick Lime be the powder that this direction makes choice
  of, yet I doubt not, but that there may be much more convenient ones
  found out, one of which I have made tryal of, and found very effectual;
  and were it not for discovering, by the mentioning of it, another Secret,
  which I am not free to impart, I should have here inserted it.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsIX" id="obsIX">IX</a>. <i>Of the Colours observable in Muscovy Glass, and
other thin Bodies</i>.</h3>

  <p>Moscovy-glass, or <i>Lapis specularis</i>, is a Body that seems to
  have as many Curiosities in its Fabrick as any common Mineral I have met
  with: for first, It is transparent to a great thickness: Next, it is
  compounded of an infinite number of thin flakes joyned or generated one
  upon another so close &amp; smooth, as with many hundreds of them to make
  one smooth and thin Plate of a transparent flexible substance, which with
  care and diligence may be flit into pieces so exceedingly thin as to be
  hardly perceivable by the eye, and yet even those, which I have thought
  the thinnest, I have with a good <i>Microscope</i> found to be made up of
  many other Plates, yet thinner; and it is probable, that, were our
  <i>Microscopes</i> much better, we might much further discover
  its divisibility. Nor are these flakes only regular as to the smoothness
  of their Surfaces, but thirdly, In many Plates they may be perceived to
  be terminated naturally with edges of the figure of a <i>Rhomboeid</i>.
  This Figure is much more conspicuous in our English talk, much whereof is
  found in the Lead Mines, and is commonly called <i>Spar</i>, and
  <i>Kauck</i>, which is of the same kind of substance with the
  <i>Selenitis</i>, but is seldom found in so large flakes as that is, nor
  is it altogether so tuff, but is much more clear and transparent, and
  much more curiously shaped, and yet may be cleft and flak'd like the
  other <i>Selenitis</i>. But fourthly, this stone has a property, which in
  respect of the <i>Microscope</i>, is more notable, and that is, that it
  exhibits several appearances of Colours, both to the naked Eye, but much
  more conspicuously to the <i>Microscope</i>; for the exhibiting of which,
  I took a piece of <i>Muscovy-glass</i>, and splitting or cleaving it into
  thin Plates, I found that up and down in several parts of them I could
  plainly perceive several white specks or flaws, and others diversly
  coloured with all the Colours of the <i>Rainbow</i>; and with the
  <i>Microscope</i> I could perceive, that these Colours were ranged in
  rings that incompassed the white speck or flaw, and were round or
  irregular, according to the shape of the spot which they terminated; and
  the position of Colours, in respect of one another, was the very same as
  in the <i>Rainbow</i>. The consecution of those Colours from the middle
  of the spot outward being Blew, Purple, Scarlet, Yellow, Green; Blew,
  Purple, Scarlet, and so onwards, sometimes half a score times repeated,
  that is, there appeared six, seven, eight, nine or ten several coloured
  rings or lines, each incircling the other, in the same manner as I have
  often seen a very <i>vivid Rainbow</i> to have four or five several Rings
  of Colours, that is, accounting all the Gradations between Red and Blew
  for one: But the order of the Colours in these Rings was quite contrary
  to the primary or innermost <i>Rainbow</i>, and the same with those of
  the secondary or outermost Rainbow; these coloured Lines or
  <i>Irises</i>, as I may so call them, were some of them much brighter
  then others, and some of them also very much broader, they being some of
  them ten, twenty, nay, I believe, neer a hundred times broader then
  others; and those usually were broadest which were neerest the center or
  middle of the flaw. And oftentimes I found, that these Colours reacht to
  the very middle of the flaw, and then there appeared in the middle a very
  large spot, for the most part, all of one colour, which was very vivid,
  and all the other Colours incompassing it, gradually ascending, and
  growing narrower towards the edges, keeping the same order, as in the
  <i>secundary Rainbow</i>, that is, if the middle were Blew, the next
  incompassing it would be a Purple, the third a Red, the fourth a Yellow,
  <i>&amp;c.</i> as above; if the middle were a Red, the next without it
  would be a Yellow, the third a Green, the fourth a Blew, and so onward.
  And this order it alwayes kept whatsoever were the middle Colour.</p>

  <p>There was further observable in several other parts of this Body, many
  Lines or Threads, each of them of some one peculiar Colour, and those so
  exceedingly bright and vivid, that it afforded a very pleasant object
  through the <i>Microscope</i>. Some of these
  <i>threads</i> I have observed also to be pieced or made up of several
  short lengths of differently coloured <i>ends</i> (as I may so call them)
  as a line appearing about two inches long through the <i>Microscope</i>,
  has been compounded of about half an inch of a Peach colour, 1/8 of a
  lovely Grass-green, 3/4 of an inch more of a bright Scarlet, and the rest
  of the line of a Watchet blew. Others of them were much otherwise
  coloured; the variety being almost infinite. Another thing which is very
  observable, is, that if you find any place where the colours are very
  broad and conspicuous to the naked eye, you may, by pressing that place
  with your finger, make the colours change places, and go from one part to
  another.</p>

  <p>There is one <i>Phænomenon</i> more, which may, if care be used,
  exhibit to the beholder, as it has divers times to me, an exceeding
  pleasant, and not less instructive Spectacle; And that is, if curiosity
  and diligence be used, you may so split this admirable Substance, that
  you may have pretty large Plates (in companion of those smaller ones
  which you may observe in the Rings) that are perhaps an 1/8 or a 1/6 part
  of an inch over, each of them appearing through the <i>Microscope</i>
  most curiously, intirely, and uniformly adorned with some one vivid
  colour: this, if examined with the <i>Microscope</i>, may be plainly
  perceived to be in all parts of it equally thick. Two, three, or more of
  these lying one upon another, exhibit oftentimes curious compounded
  colours, which produce such a <i>Compositum</i>, as one would scarce
  imagine should be the result of such <i>ingredients</i>: As perhaps a
  <i>faint yellow</i> and a <i>blew</i> may produce a very <i>deep
  purple</i>. But when anon we come to the more strict examination of these
  <i>Phænomena</i>, and to inquire into the causes and reasons of these
  productions, we shall, I hope, make it more conceivable how they are
  produced, and shew them to be no other then the natural and necessary
  effects arising from the peculiar union of concurrent causes.</p>

  <p>These <i>Phænomena</i>, being so various, and so truly admirable, it
  will certainly be very well worth our inquiry, to examine the causes and
  reasons of them, and to consider, whether from these causes
  demonstratively evidenced, may not be deduced the true causes of the
  production of all kind of Colours. And I the rather now do it, instead of
  an Appendix or Digression to this History, then upon the occasion of
  examining the Colours in Peacocks, or other Feathers, because this
  Subject, as it does afford more variety of particular Colours, so does it
  afford much better wayes of examining each circumstance. And this will be
  made manifest to him that considers, first, that this laminated body is
  more simple and regular then the parts of Peacocks feathers, this
  consisting only of an indefinite number of plain and smooth Plates,
  heaped up, or <i>incumbent</i> on each other. Next, that the parts of
  this body are much more manageable, to be divided or joyned, then the
  parts of a Peacocks feather, or any other substance that I know. And
  thirdly, because that in this we are able from a colourless body to
  produce several coloured bodies, affording all the variety of Colours
  imaginable: And several others, which the subsequent Inquiry will make
  manifest.</p>

  <p>To begin therefore, it is manifest from several circumstances, that
  the material cause of the <i>apparition</i> of these several Colours, is
  some <i>Lamina</i> or Plate of a transparent or pellucid body of a
  thickness very determinate and proportioned according to the greater or
  less refractive power of the <i>pellucid</i> body. And that this is so,
  abundance of Instances and particular Circumstances will make
  manifest.</p>

  <p>As <i>first</i>, if you take any small piece of the
  <i>Muscovy-glass</i>, and with a Needle, or some other convenient
  Instrument, cleave it oftentimes into thinner and thinner <i>Laminæ</i>,
  you shall find, that till you come to a determinate thinness of them,
  they shall all appear transparent and colourless, but if you continue to
  split and divide them further, you shall find at last, that each Plate,
  after it comes to such a determinate thickness, shall appear most lovely
  ting'd or imbued with a determinate colour. If <i>further</i>, by any
  means you so flaw a pretty thick piece, that one part does begin to
  cleave a little from the other, and between those two there be by any
  means gotten some pellucid <i>medium</i>, those <i>laminated</i> pellucid
  bodies that fill that space, shall exhibit several Rainbows or coloured
  Lines, the colours of which will be disposed and ranged according to the
  various thicknesses of the several parts of that Plate. That this is so,
  is yet <i>further</i> confirmed by this Experiment.</p>

  <p>Take two small pieces of ground and polisht Looking-glass-plate, each
  about the bigness of a shilling, take these two dry, and with your
  fore-fingers and thumbs press them very hard and close together, and you
  shall find, that when they approach each other very near, there will
  appear several <i>Irises</i> or coloured Lines, in the same manner almost
  as in the <i>Muscovy-glass</i>; and you may very easily change any of the
  Colours of any part of the interposed body, by pressing the Plates closer
  and harder together, or leaving them more lax; that is, a part which
  appeared coloured with a red, may be presently ting'd with a yellow,
  blew, green, purple, or the like, by altering the appropinquation of the
  terminating Plates. Now that air is not necessary to be the interposed
  body, but that any other transparent fluid will do much the same, may be
  tryed by wetting those approximated Surfaces with Water, or any other
  transparent Liquor, and proceeding with it in the same manner as you did
  with the Air; and you will find much the like effect, only with this
  difference, that those comprest bodies, which differ most, in their
  refractive quality, from the compressing bodies, exhibit the most strong
  and vivid tinctures. Nor is it necessary, that this <i>laminated</i> and
  <i>ting'd</i> body should be of a fluid substance, any other substance,
  provided it be thin enough and transparent, doing the same thing: this
  the <i>Laminæ</i> of our <i>Muscovy-glass</i> hint; but it may be
  confirm'd by multitudes of other Instances.</p>

  <p>And first, we shall find, that even Glass it self may, by the help of
  a Lamp, be blown thin enough to produce these <i>Phænomena</i> of
  Colours: which <i>Phænomena</i> accidentally happening, as I have been
  attempting to frame small Glasses with a Lamp, did not a little surprize
  me at first, having never heard or seen any thing of it before; though
  afterwards comparing it with the <i>Phænomena</i>, I had often
  observed in those Bubbles which Children use to make with Soap-water, I
  did the less wonder; especially when upon Experiment I found, I was able
  to produce the same <i>Phænomena</i> in thin Bubbles made with any other
  transparent Substance. Thus have I produced them with Bubbles of
  <i>Pitch</i>, <i>Rosin</i>, <i>Colophony</i>, <i>Turpentine</i>,
  <i>Solutions</i> of several <i>Gums</i>, as <i>Gum-Arabick</i> in water;
  any <i>glutinous</i> Liquor, as <i>Wort</i>, <i>Wine</i>, <i>Spirit of
  Wine</i>, <i>Oyl of Turpentine</i>, <i>Glare of Snails,</i> &amp;c.</p>

  <p>It would be needless to enumerate the several Instances, these being
  enough to shew the generality or universality of this propriety. Only I
  must not omit, that we have instances also of this kind even in metalline
  Bodies and animal; for those several Colours which are observed to follow
  each other upon the polisht surface of hardned Steel, when it is by a
  sufficient degree of heat gradually tempered or softened, are produced,
  from nothing else but a certain thin <i>Lamina</i> of a <i>vitrum</i> or
  <i>vitrified</i> part of the Metal, which by that degree of heat, and the
  concurring action of the ambient Air, is driven out and fixed on the
  surface of the Steel.</p>

  <p>And this hints to me a very probable (at least, if not the true) cause
  of the hardning and tempering of Steel, which has not, I think, been yet
  given, nor, that I know of been so much as thought of by any. And that is
  this, that the hardness of it arises from a greater proportion of a
  vitrified Substance interspersed through the pores of the Steel. And that
  the tempering or softning of it arises from the proportionate or smaller
  parcels of it left within those pores. This will seem the more probable,
  if we consider these Particulars.</p>

  <p>First, That the pure parts of Metals are of themselves very
  <i>flexible</i> and <i>tuff</i>; that is, will indure bending and
  hammering, and yet retain their continuity.</p>

  <p>Next, That the Parts of all vitrified Substances, as all kinds of
  Glass, the <i>Scoria</i> of Metals, <i>&amp;c.</i> are very hard, and
  also very brittle, being neither <i>flexible</i> nor <i>malleable</i>,
  but may by hammering or beating be broken into small parts or
  powders.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, That all Metals (excepting Gold and Silver, which do not so
  much with the bare fire, unless assisted by other saline Bodies) do more
  or less <i>vitrifie</i> by the strength of fire, that is, are corroded by
  a saline Substance, which I elsewhere shew to be the true cause of fire;
  and are thereby, as by several other <i>Menstruums</i> converted into
  <i>Scoria</i>; And this is called, <i>calcining</i> of them, by Chimists.
  Thus Iron and Copper by heating and quenching do turn all of them by
  degrees into <i>Scoria</i>, which are evidently <i>vitrified</i>
  Substances, and unite with Glass, and are easily <i>fusible</i>; and when
  cold, very hard, and very brittle.</p>

  <p>Fourthly, That most kind of <i>Vitrifications</i> or
  <i>Calcinations</i> are made by Salts, uniting and incorporating with the
  metalline Particles. Nor do I know any one <i>calcination</i> wherein a
  <i>Saline</i> body may not, with very great probability, be said to be an
  agent or coadjutor.</p>

  <p>Fifthly, That Iron is converted into Steel by means of the
  incorporation of certain salts, with which it is kept a certain time in
  the fire.</p>

  <p>Sixthly, That any Iron may, in a very little time, be <i>case
  hardned</i>, as the Trades-men call it, by casing the iron to be hardned
  with clay, and putting between the clay and iron a good quantity of a
  mixture of <i>Urine</i>, <i>Soot</i>, <i>Sea-salt</i>, and <i>Horses
  hoofs</i> (all which contein great quantities of Saline bodies) and then
  putting the case into a good strong fire, and keeping it in a
  considerable degree of heat for a good while, and afterwards heating, and
  quenching or cooling it suddenly in cold water.</p>

  <p>Seventhly, That all kind of vitrify'd substances, by being suddenly
  cool'd, become very hard and brittle. And thence arises the pretty
  <i>Phænomena</i> of the Glass Drops, which I have already further
  explained in its own place.</p>

  <p>Eighthly, That those metals which are not so apt to vitrifie, do not
  acquire any hardness by quenching in water, as Silver, Gold, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>These considerations premis'd, will, I suppose, make way for the more
  easie reception of this following Explication of the <i>Phænomena</i> of
  hardned and temper'd Steel. That Steel is a substance made out of Iron,
  by means of a certain proportionate <i>Vitrification</i> of several
  parts, which are so curiously and proportionately mixt with the more
  tough and unalter'd parts of the Iron, that when by the great heat of the
  fire this vitrify'd substance is melted, and consequently rarify'd, and
  thereby the pores of the Iron are more open, if then by means of dipping
  it in cold water it be suddenly cold, and the parts hardned, that is,
  stay'd in that same degree of <i>Expansion</i> they were in when hot, the
  parts become very hard and brittle, and that upon the same account almost
  as small parcels of glass quenched in water grow brittle, which we have
  already explicated. If after this the piece of Steel be held in some
  convenient heat, till by degrees certain colours appear upon the surface
  of the brightned metal, the very hard and brittle tone of the metal, by
  degrees relaxes and becomes much more tough and soft; namely, the action
  of the heat does by degrees loosen the parts of the Steel that were
  before streached or set <i>atilt</i> as it were, and stayed open by each
  other, whereby they become relaxed and set at liberty, whence some of the
  more brittle interjacent parts are thrust out and melted into a thin skin
  on the surface of the Steel, which from no colour increases to a deep
  Purple, and so onward by these <i>gradations</i> or consecutions,
  <i>White, Yellow, Orange, Minium, Scarlet, Purple, Blew, Watchet,</i>
  &amp;c. and the parts within are more conveniently, and proportionately
  mixt; and so they gradually subside into a texture which is much better
  proportion'd and closer joyn'd, whence that rigidnesse of parts ceases,
  and the parts begin to acquire their former <i>ductilness</i>.</p>

  <p>Now, that 'tis nothing but the vitrify'd metal that sticks upon the
  surface of the colour'd body, is evident from this, that if by any means
  it be scraped and rubb'd off, the metal underneath it is white and clear;
  and if it be kept longer in the fire, so as to increase to a considerable
  thickness, it may, by blows, be beaten off in flakes. This is further
  confirm'd by this observable, that that Iron or Steel will keep longer
  from rusting which is covered with this vitrify'd case: Thus also Lead
  will, by degrees, be all turn'd into a litharge; for
  that colour which covers the top being scum'd or shov'd aside, appears to
  be nothing else but a litharge or vitrify'd Lead.</p>

  <p>This is observable also in some sort, on Brass, Copper, Silver, Gold,
  Tin, but is most conspicuous in Lead: all those Colours that cover the
  surface of the Metal being nothing else, but a very thin vitrifi'd part
  of the heated Metal.</p>

  <p>The other Instance we have, is in Animal bodies, as in Pearls, Mother
  of Pearl-shels, Oyster-shels, and almost all other kinds of stony shels
  whatsoever. This have I also sometimes with pleasure observ'd even in
  Muscles and Tendons. Further, if you take any glutinous substance and run
  it exceedingly thin upon the surface of a smooth glass or a polisht
  metaline body, you shall find the like effects produced: and in general,
  wheresoever you meet with a transparent body thin enough, that is
  terminated by reflecting bodies of differing refractions from it, there
  will be a production of these pleasing and lovely colours.</p>

  <p>Nor is it necessary, that the two <i>terminating</i> Bodies should be
  both of the same kind, as may appear by the <i>vitrified Laminæ</i> on
  <i>Steel</i>, <i>Lead</i>, and other Metals, one surface of which
  <i>Laminæ</i> is contiguous to the surface of the Metal, the other to
  that of the Air.</p>

  <p>Nor is it necessary, that these colour'd <i>Laminæ</i> should be of an
  even thickness, that is, should have their edges and middles of equal
  thickness, as in a Looking-glass-plate, which circumstance is only
  requisite to make the Plate appear all of the same colour; but they may
  resemble a <i>Lens</i>, that is, have their middles thicker then their
  edges; or else a <i>double concave</i>, that is, be thinner in the middle
  then at the edges; in both which cases there will be various coloured
  rings or lines, with differing consecutions or orders of Colours; the
  order of the first from the middle outwards being Red, Yellow, Green,
  Blew, <i>&amp;c.</i> And the latter quite contrary.</p>

  <p>But further, it is altogether necessary, that the Plate, in the places
  where the Colours appear, should be of a determinate thickness: First, It
  must not be more then such a thickness, for when the Plate is increased
  to such a thickness, the Colours cease; and besides, I have seen in a
  thin piece of <i>Muscovy-glass</i>, where the two ends of two Plates,
  which appearing both single, exhibited two distinct and differing
  Colours; but in that place where they were united, and constituted one
  double Plate (as I may call it) they appeared transparent and colourless.
  Nor, Secondly, may the Plates be <i>thinner</i> then such a determinate
  <i>cize</i>; for we alwayes find, that the very outmost Rim of these
  flaws is terminated in a white and colourless Ring.</p>

  <p>Further, in this Production of Colours there is no need of a
  determinate Light of such a bigness and no more, nor of a determinate
  position of that Light, that it should be on this side, and not on that
  side; nor of a terminating shadow, as in the Prisme, and Rainbow, or
  Water-ball: for we find, that the Light in the open Air, either in or out
  of the Sun-beams, and within a Room, either from one or many Windows,
  produces much the same effect: only where the Light is
  brightest, there the Colours are most <i>vivid</i>. So does the light of
  a Candle, collected by a Glass-ball. And further, it is all one whatever
  side of the coloured Rings be towards the light; for the whole Ring keeps
  its proper Colours from the middle outwards in the same order as I before
  related, without varying at all, upon changing the position of the
  light.</p>

  <p>But above all it is most observable, that here are all kind of Colours
  generated in a <i>pellucid</i> body, where there is properly no such
  refraction as <i>Des Cartes</i> supposes his <i>Globules</i> to acquire a
  <i>vertuity</i> by: For in the plain and even Plates it is manifest, that
  the second refraction (according to <i>Des Cartes</i> his Principles in
  the <i>fifth section of the eighth Chapter of his Meteors</i>) does
  regulate and restore the supposed <i>turbinated Globules</i> unto their
  former uniform motion. This Experiment therefore will prove such a one as
  our <i>thrice excellent Verulam</i> calls <i>Experimentum Crucis</i>,
  serving as a Guide or Land-mark, by which to direct our course in the
  search after the true cause of Colours. Affording us this particular
  negative Information, that for the production of Colours there is not
  necessary either a great refraction, as in the Prisme; nor Secondly, a
  determination of Light and shadow, such as is both in the Prisme and
  Glass-ball. Now that we may see likewise what affirmative and positive
  Instruction it yields, it will be necessary, to examine it a little more
  particularly and strictly; which that we may the better do, it will be
  requisite to premise somewhat in general concerning the nature of Light
  and Refraction.</p>

  <p>And first for Light it seems very manifest, that there is no luminous
  Body but has the parts of it in motion more or less.</p>

  <p>First, That all kind of <i>fiery burning Bodies</i> have their parts
  in motion, I think, will be very easily granted me. That the <i>spark</i>
  struck from a Flint and Steel is in a rapid agitation, I have elsewhere
  made probable. And that the Parts of <i>rotten Wood</i>, <i>rotten
  Fish</i> and the like, are also in motion, I think, will as easily be
  conceded by those, who consider, that those parts never begin to shine
  till the Bodies be in a state of putrefaction; and that is now generally
  granted by all, to be caused by the motion of the parts of putrifying
  bodies. That the <i>Bononian stone</i> shines no longer then it is either
  warmed by the Sun-beams, or by the flame of a Fire or of a Candle, is the
  general report of those that write of it, and of others that have seen
  it. And that heat argues a motion of the internal parts is (as I said
  before) generally granted.</p>

  <p>But there is one Instance more, which was first shewn to the <i>Royal
  Society</i> by Mr. <i>Clayton</i> a worthy Member thereof, which does
  make this Assertion more evident then all the rest: And that is, That a
  <i>Diamond</i> being <i>rub'd</i>, <i>struck</i> or <i>heated</i> in the
  dark, shines for a pretty while after, so long as that motion, which is
  imparted by any of those Agents, remains (in the same manner as a Glass,
  rubb'd, struck, or (by a means which I shall elsewhere mention) heated,
  yields a sound which lasts as long as the vibrating motion of that
  <i>sonorous</i> body) several Experiments made on which Stone, are since
  published in a Discourse of Colours, by the truly honourable
  Mr. <i>Boyle</i>. What may be said of those <i>Ignes fatui</i> that
  appear in the night, I cannot so well affirm, having never had the
  opportunity to examine them my self, nor to be inform'd by any others
  that had observ'd them: And the relations of them in Authors are so
  imperfect, that nothing can be built on them. But I hope I shall be able
  in another place to make it at least very probable, that there is even in
  those also a Motion which causes this effect. That the shining of
  <i>Sea-water</i> proceeds from the same cause, may be argued from this,
  That it shines not till either it be beaten against a Rock, or be some
  other wayes broken or agitated by Storms, or Oars, or other
  <i>percussing</i> bodies. And that the Animal <i>Energyes</i> or
  Spirituous <i>agil</i> parts are very active in <i>Cats eyes</i> when
  they shine, seems evident enough, because their eyes never shine but when
  they look very intensly either to find their prey, or being hunted in a
  dark room, when they seek after their adversary, or to find a way to
  escape. And the like may be said of the shining <i>Bellies of
  Gloworms</i>; since 'tis evident they can at pleasure either increase or
  extinguish that Radiation.</p>

  <p>It would be somewhat too long a work for this place <i>Zetetically</i>
  to examine, and positively to prove, what particular kind of motion it is
  that must be the efficient of Light; for though it be a motion, yet 'tis
  not every motion that produces it, since we find there are many bodies
  very violently mov'd, which yet afford not such an effect; and there are
  other bodies, which to our other senses, seem not mov'd so much, which
  yet shine. Thus Water and quick-silver, and most other liquors heated,
  shine not; and several hard bodies, as Iron, Silver, Brass, Copper, Wood,
  &amp;c. though very often struck with a hammer, shine not presently,
  though they will all of them grow exceeding hot; whereas rotten Wood,
  rotten Fish, Sea water, Gloworms, <i>&amp;c.</i> have nothing of tangible
  heat in them, and yet (where there is no stronger light to affect the
  Sensory) they shine some of them so Vividly, that one may make a shift to
  read by them.</p>

  <p>It would be too long, I say, here to insert the discursive progress by
  which I inquir'd after the proprieties of the motion of Light, and
  therefore I shall only add the result.</p>

  <p>And, First, I found it ought to be exceeding <i>quick</i>, such as
  those motions of <i>fermentation</i> and <i>putrefaction</i>, whereby,
  certainly, the parts are exceeding nimbly and violently mov'd; and that,
  because we find those motions are able more minutely to shatter and
  divide the body, then the most violent heats <i>menstruums</i> we yet
  know. And that fire is nothing else but such a <i>dissolution</i> of the
  Burning body, made by the most <i>universal menstruum</i> of all
  <i>sulphureous bodies</i>, namely, the Air, we shall in an other place of
  this Tractate endeavour to make probable. And that, in all extreamly hot
  shining bodies, there is a very quick motion that causes Light, as well
  as a more robust that causes Heat, may be argued from the celerity
  wherewith the bodyes are dissolv'd.</p>

  <p>Next, it must be a <i>Vibrative motion</i>. And for this the newly
  mention'd <i>Diamond</i> affords us a good argument; since if the motion
  of the parts did not return, the Diamond must after many
  rubbings decay and be wasted: but we have no reason to suspect the
  latter, especially if we consider the exceeding difficulty that is found
  in cutting or wearing away a Diamond. And a Circular motion of the parts
  is much more improbable, since, if that were granted, and they be
  suppos'd irregular and Angular parts, I see not how the parts of the
  Diamond should hold so firmly together, or remain in the same sensible
  dimensions, which yet they do. Next, if they be <i>Globular</i>, and
  mov'd only with a <i>turbinated</i> motion, I know not any cause that can
  impress that motion upon the <i>pellucid medium</i>, which yet is done.
  Thirdly, any other <i>irregular</i> motion of the parts one amongst
  another, must necessarily make the body of a fluid consistence, from
  which it is far enough. It must therefore be a <i>Vibrating</i>
  motion.</p>

  <p>And Thirdly, That it is a very <i>short-vibrating motion</i>, I think
  the instances drawn from the shining of Diamonds will also make probable.
  For a Diamond being the hardest body we yet know in the World, and
  consequently the least apt to yield or bend, must consequently also have
  its <i>vibrations</i> exceeding short.</p>

  <p>And these, I think, are the three principal proprieties of a motion,
  requisite to produce the effect call'd Light in the Object.</p>

  <p>The next thing we are to consider, is the way or manner of the
  <i>trajection</i> of this motion through the interpos'd pellucid body to
  the eye: And here it will be easily granted,</p>

  <p>First, That it must be a body <i>susceptible</i> and <i>impartible</i>
  of this motion that will deserve the name of a Transparent. And next,
  that the parts of such a body must be <i>Homogeneous</i>, or of the same
  kind. Thirdly, that the constitution and motion of the parts must be
  such, that the appulse of the luminous body may be communicated or
  propagated through it to the greatest imaginable distance in the least
  imaginable time, though I see no reason to affirm, that it must be in an
  instant: For I know not any one Experiment or observation that does prove
  it. And, whereas it may be objected, That we see the Sun risen at the
  very instant when it is above the sensible Horizon, and that we see a
  Star hidden by the body of the Moon at the same instant, when the Star,
  the Moon, and our Eye are all in the same line; and the like
  Observations, or rather suppositions, may be urg'd. I have this to
  answer, That I can as easily deny as they affirm; for I would fain know
  by what means any one can be assured any more of the Affirmative, then I
  of the Negative. If indeed the propagation were very slow, 'tis possible
  something might be discovered by Eclypses of the Moon; but though we
  should grant the progress of the light from the Earth to the Moon, and
  from the Moon back to the Earth again to be full two Minutes in
  performing, I know not any possible means to discover it; nay, there may
  be some instances perhaps of Horizontal Eclypses that may seem very much
  to favour this supposition of the slower progression of Light then most
  imagine. And the like may be said of the Eclypses of the Sun, &amp;c. But
  of this only by the by. Fourthly, That the motion is propagated every way
  through an <i>Homogeneous medium</i> by <i>direct</i> or
  <i>straight</i> lines extended every way like Rays from the center of a
  Sphere. Fifthly, in an <i>Homogeneous medium</i> this motion is
  propagated every way with <i>equal velocity</i>, whence necessarily every
  <i>pulse</i> or <i>vitration</i> of the luminous body will generate a
  Sphere, which will continually increase, and grow bigger, just after the
  same manner (though indefinitely swifter) as the waves or rings on the
  surface of the water do swell into bigger and bigger circles about a
  point of it, where, by the sinking of a Stone the motion was begun,
  whence it necessarily follows, that all the parts of these Spheres
  undulated through an <i>Homogeneous medium</i> cut the Rays at right
  angles.</p>

  <p>But because all transparent <i>mediums</i> are not <i>Homogeneous</i>
  to one another, therefore we will next examine how this pulse or motion
  will be propagated through differingly transparent <i>mediums</i>. And
  here, according to the most acute and excellent Philosopher <i>Des
  Cartes</i>, I suppose the sign of the angle of inclination in the first
  <i>medium</i> to be to the sign of refraction in the second, As the
  density of the first, to the density of the second. By density, I mean
  not the density in respect of gravity (with which the refractions or
  transparency of <i>mediums</i> hold no proportion) but in respect onely
  to the <i>trajection</i> of the Rays of light, in which respect they only
  differ in this; that the one propagates the pulse more easily and weakly,
  the other more slowly, but more strongly. But as for the pulses
  themselves, they will by the refraction acquire another propriety, which
  we shall now endeavour to explicate.</p>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-06.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 6.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 1.
</span>
  <p>We will suppose therefore in the first Figure ACFD to be a physical
  Ray, or ABC and DEF to be two Mathematical Rays, <i>trajected</i> from a
  very remote point of a luminous body through an <i>Homogeneous</i>
  transparent <i>medium</i> LLL, and DA, EB, FC, to be small portions of
  the orbicular impulses which must therefore cut the Rays at right angles;
  these Rays meeting with the plain surface NO of a <i>medium</i> that
  yields an easier <i>transitus</i> to the propagation of light, and
  falling <i>obliquely</i> on it, they will in the <i>medium</i> MMM be
  refracted towards the perpendicular of the surface. And because this
  <i>medium</i> is more easily <i>trajected</i> then the former by a third,
  therefore the point C of the orbicular pulse FC will be mov'd to H four
  spaces in the same time that F the other end of it is mov'd to G three
  spaces, therefore the whole refracted pulse GH shall be <i>oblique</i> to
  the refracted Rays CHK and GI; and the angle GHC shall be an acute, and
  so much the more acute by how much the greater the refraction be, then
  which nothing is more evident, for the sign of the inclination is to the
  sign of refraction as GF to TC the distance between the point C and the
  perpendicular from G on CK, which being as four to three, HC being longer
  then GF is longer also then TC, therefore the angle GHC is less than GTC.
  So that henceforth the parts of the pulses GH and IK are mov'd ascew, or
  cut the Rays at <i>oblique</i> angles.</p>

  <p>It is not my business in this place to set down the reasons why this
  or that body should impede the Rays more, others less: as why Water
  should transmit the Rays more easily, though more weakly than air. Onely
  thus much in general I shall hint, that I suppose
  the <i>medium</i> MMM to have less of the transparent undulating subtile
  matter, and that matter to be less implicated by it, whereas LLL I
  suppose to contain a greater quantity of the fluid undulating substance,
  and this to be more implicated with the particles of that
  <i>medium</i>.</p>

  <p>But to proceed, the same kind of <i>obliquity</i> of the Pulses and
  Rays will happen also when the refraction is made out of a more easie
  into a more difficult <i>medi&#363;</i>; as by the calculations of GQ
  &amp; CSR which are refracted from the perpendicular. In both which
  calculations 'tis <i>obvious</i> to observe, that always that part of the
  Ray towards which the refraction is made has the end of the <i>orbicular
  pulse</i> precedent to that of the other side. And always, the oftner the
  refraction is made the same way, Or the greater the single refraction is,
  the more is this unequal progress. So that having found this odd
  propriety to be an inseparable concomitant of a refracted Ray, not
  streightned by a contrary refraction, we will next examine the
  refractions of the Sun-beams, as they are suffer'd onely to pass through
  a small passage, <i>obliquely</i> out of a more difficult, into a more
  easie <i>medium</i>.</p>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-06.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 6.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 2.
</span>
  <p>Let us suppose therefore ABC in the second Figure to represent a large
  <i>Chimical Glass-body</i> about two foot long, filled with very fair
  Water as high as AB, and inclin'd in a convenient posture with B towards
  the Sun: Let us further suppose the top of it to be cover'd with an
  <i>opacous</i> body, all but the hole <i>ab</i>, through which the
  Sun-beams are suffer'd to pass into the Water, and are thereby refracted
  to <i>cdef</i>, against which part, if a Paper be expanded on the
  outside, there will appear all the colours of the Rain-bow, that is,
  there will be generated the two principal colours, <i>Scarlet</i> and
  <i>Blue</i>, and all the <i>intermediate</i> ones which arise from the
  composition and dilutings of these two, that is, <i>cd</i> shall exhibit
  a <i>Scarlet</i>, which toward <i>d</i> is diluted into a <i>Yellow</i>;
  this is the refraction of the Ray, <i>ik</i>, which comes from the
  underside of the Sun; and the Ray <i>ef</i> shall appear of a deep
  <i>Blue</i>, which is gradually towards <i>e</i> diluted into a pale
  <i>Watchet-blue</i>. Between <i>d</i> and <i>e</i> the two <i>diluted</i>
  colours. <i>Blue</i> and <i>Yellow</i> are mixt and compounded into a
  <i>Green</i>; and this I imagine to be the reason why <i>Green</i> is so
  acceptable a colour to the eye, and that either of the two extremes are,
  if intense, rather a little offensive, namely, the being plac'd in the
  middle between the two extremes, and compounded out of both those,
  <i>diluted</i> also, or somewhat qualifi'd, for the <i>composition</i>,
  arising from the mixture of the two extremes <i>undiluted</i>, makes a
  <i>Purple</i>, which though it be a lovely colour, and pretty acceptable
  to the eye, yet is it nothing comparable to the ravishing pleasure with
  which a curious and well tempered <i>Green</i> affects the eye. If
  removing the Paper, the eye be plac'd against <i>cd</i>, it will perceive
  the lower side of the Sun (or a Candle at night which is much better,
  because it offends not the eye, and is more easily manageable) to be of a
  deep <i>Red</i>, and if against <i>ef</i> it will perceive the upper part
  of the luminous body to be of a deep <i>Blue</i>; and these colours will
  appear deeper and deeper, according as the Rays from the luminous body
  fall more <i>obliquely</i> on the surface of the Water, and thereby
  suffer a greater refraction, and the more
  distinct, the further <i>cdef</i> is removed from the trajecting
  hole.</p>

  <p>So that upon the whole, we shall find that the reason of the
  <i>Phænomena</i> seems to depend upon the <i>obliquity</i> of the
  <i>orbicular pulse</i>, to the Lines of Radiation, and in particular,
  that the Ray <i>cd</i> which constitutes the <i>Scarlet</i> has its inner
  parts, namely those which are next to the middle of the luminous body,
  precedent to the outermost which are contiguous to the dark and
  <i>unradiating</i> skie. And that the Ray <i>ef</i> which gives a
  <i>Blue</i>, has its outward part, namely, that which is contiguous to
  the dark side precedent to the pulse from the innermost, which borders on
  the bright <i>area</i> of the luminous body.</p>

  <p>We may observe further, that the cause of the <i>diluting</i> of the
  colours towards the middle, proceeds partly from the wideness of the hole
  through which the Rays pass, whereby the Rays from several parts of the
  luminous body, fall upon many of the same parts between <i>c</i> and
  <i>f</i> as is more manifest by the Figure: And partly also from the
  nature of the refraction it self, for the vividness or strength of the
  two terminating colours, arising chiefly as we have seen, from the very
  great difference that is betwixt the outsides of those <i>oblique
  undulations</i> &amp; the dark Rays circumambient, and that disparity
  betwixt the <i>approximate</i> Rays, decaying gradually: the further
  inward toward the middle of the luminous body they are remov'd, the more
  must the colour approach to a white or an undisturbed light.</p>

  <p>Upon the calculation of the refraction and reflection from a Ball of
  Water or Glass, we have much the same <i>Phænomena</i>, namely, an
  <i>obliquity</i> of the undulation in the same manner as we have found it
  here. Which, because it is very much to our present purpose, and affords
  such an <i>Instancia crucis</i>, as no one that I know has hitherto taken
  notice of, I shall further examine. For it does very plainly and
  positively distinguish, and shew, which of the two <i>Hypotheses</i>,
  either the <i>Cartesian</i> or this is to be followed, by affording a
  generation of all the colors in the Rainbow, where according to the
  <i>Cartesian Principles</i> there should be none at all generated. And
  secondly, by affording an instance that does more closely confine the
  cause of these <i>Phænomena</i> of colours to this present
  <i>Hypothesis</i>.</p>

  <p>And first, for the <i>Cartesian</i>, we have this to object against
  it, That whereas he says (<i>Meteorum Cap. 8. Sect. 5.</i>) <i>Sed
  judicabam unicam (refractione scilicet) ad minim&#363; requiri, &amp;
  quidem talem ut ejus effectus aliâ contrariâ (refractione) non
  destruatur: Nam experientia docet si superficies </i>NM<i> &amp;
  </i>NP<i> (nempe refringentes) Parallelæ forent, radios tantundem per
  alteram iterum erectos quantum per unam frangerentur, nullos colores
  depicturos</i>; This Principle of his holds true indeed in a prisme where
  the refracting surfaces are plain, but is contradicted by the Ball or
  Cylinder, whether of Water Or Glass, where the refracting surfaces are
  Orbicular or Cylindrical. For if we examine the passage of any
  <i>Globule</i> or Ray of the primary <i>Iris</i>, we shall find it to
  pass out of the Ball or Cylinder again, with the same inclination and
  refraction that it enter'd in withall, and that that last refraction by
  means of the <i>intermediate</i> reflection shall be the same as if
  without any reflection at all the Ray had been twice refracted by two
  Parallel surfaces.</p>

  <p>And that this is true, not onely in one, but in every Ray that goes to
  the constitution of the Primary Iris; nay, in every Ray, that suffers
  only two refractions, and one reflection, by the surface of the round
  body, we shall presently see most evident, if we repeat the <i>Cartesian
  Scheme</i>, mentioned in the tenth <i>Section</i> of the eighth
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-06.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 6.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 3.
</span>
  <i>Chapter</i> of his <i>Meteors</i>, where EFKNP in the third Figure
  is one of the
  Rays of the Primary Iris, twice refracted at F and N, and once reflected
  at K by the surface of the Water-ball. For, first it is evident, that KF
  and KN are equal, because KN being the reflected part of KF they have
  both the same inclination on the surface K that is the angles FKT, and
  NKV made by the two Rays and the Tangent of K are equal, which is evident
  by the Laws of reflection; whence it will follow also, that KN has the
  same inclination on the surface N, or the Tangent of it XN that the Ray
  KF has to the surface F, or the Tangent of it FY, whence it must
  necessarily follow, that the refractions at F and N are equal, that is,
  KFE and KNP are equal. Now, that the surface N is by the reflection at K
  made parallel to the surface at F, is evident from the principles of
  reflection; for reflection being nothing but an inverting of the Rays, if
  we re-invert the Ray KNP, and make the same inclinations below the line
  TKV that it has above, it will be most evident, that KH the inverse of KN
  will be the continuation of the line FK, and that LHI the inverse of OX
  is parallel to FY. And HM the inverse of NP is Parallel to EF for the
  angle KHI is equal to KNO which is equal to KFY, and the angle KHM is
  equal to KNP which is equal to KFE which was to be prov'd.</p>

  <p>So that according to the above mentioned <i>Cartesian</i> principles
  there should be generated no colour at all in a Ball of Water or Glass by
  two refractions and one reflection, which does hold most true indeed, if
  the surfaces be plain, as may be experimented with any kind of prisme
  where the two refracting surfaces are equally inclin'd to the reflecting;
  but in this the <i>Phænomena</i> are quite otherwise.</p>

  <p>The cause therefore of the generation of colour must not be what
  <i>Des Cartes</i> assigns, namely, a certain <i>rotation</i> of the
  <i>Globuli ætherei</i>, which are the particles which he supposes to
  constitute the <i>Pellucid medium</i>, But somewhat else, perhaps what we
  have lately supposed, and shall by and by further prosecute and
  explain.</p>

  <p>But, First I shall crave leave to propound some other difficulties of
  his, notwithstanding exceedingly ingenious <i>Hypothesis</i>, which I
  plainly confess to me seem such; and those are,</p>

  <p>First, if that light be (as is affirmed, <i>Diopt.</i> cap. 1. §. 8.)
  not so properly a motion, as an action or propension to motion, I cannot
  conceive how the eye can come to be sensible of the <i>verticity</i> of a
  <i>Globule</i>, which is generated in a drop of Rain, perhaps a mile off
  from it. For that <i>Globule</i> is not carry'd to the eye according to
  his formerly recited Principle; and if not so, I cannot conceive how it
  can communicate its <i>rotation</i>, or circular motion to the line of
  the <i>Globules</i> between the drop and the eye. It cannot be by means
  of every ones turning the next before him; for if so, then onely all the
  <i>Globules</i> that are in the odd places must be turned the same
  way with the first, namely, the 3. 5. 7. 9.
  11, <i>&amp;c.</i> but all the <i>Globules</i> interposited between them
  in the even places; namely, the 2. 4. 6. 8. 10. <i>&amp;c.</i> must be
  the quite contrary, whence, according to the <i>Cartesian Hypothesis</i>,
  there must be no distinct colour generated, but a confusion. Next, since
  the <i>Cartesian Globuli</i> are suppos'd (<i>Principiorum Philosoph.</i>
  Part. 3. §. 86.) to be each of them continually in motion about their
  centers, I cannot conceive how the eye is able to distinguish this new
  generated motion from their former inherent one, if I may so call that
  other wherewith they are mov'd or <i>turbinated</i>, from some other
  cause than refraction. And thirdly, I cannot conceive how these motions
  should not happen sometimes to oppose each other, and then, in stead of a
  <i>rotation</i>, there would be nothing but a direct motion generated,
  and consequently no colour. And fourthly, I cannot conceive, how by the
  <i>Cartesian Hypothesis</i> it is possible to give any plausible reason
  of the nature of the Colours generated in the thin <i>laminæ</i> of these
  our <i>Microscopical Observations</i>; for in many of these, the
  refracting and reflecting surfaces are parallel to each other, and
  consequently no <i>rotation</i> can be generated, nor is there any
  necessity of a shadow or termination of the bright Rays, such as is
  suppos'd (<i>Chap.</i> 8. §. 5. <i>Et præterea observavi umbram quoque,
  aut limitationem luminis requiri:</i> and <i>Chap.</i> 8. §. 9.) to be
  necessary to the generation of any distinct colours; Besides that, here
  is oftentimes one colour generated without any of the other appendant
  ones, which cannot be by the <i>Cartesian Hypothesis</i>.</p>

  <p>There must be therefore some other propriety of refraction that causes
  colour. And upon the examination of the thing, I cannot conceive any one
  more general, inseparable, and sufficient, than that which I have before
  assign'd. That we may therefore see how exactly our <i>Hypothesis</i>
  agrees also with the <i>Phænomena</i> of the refracting round body,
  whether <i>Globe</i> or <i>Cylinder</i>, we shall next subjoyn our
  <i>Calculation</i> or <i>Examen</i> of it.</p>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-06.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 6.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 3.
</span>
  <p>And to this end, we will calculate any two Rays: as for instance;
  let EF be a
  Ray cutting the <i>Radius</i> CD (divided into 20. parts) in G 16. parts
  distant from C, and <i>ef</i> another Ray, which cuts the same
  <i>Radius</i> in <i>g</i> 17. parts distant, these will be refracted to K
  and <i>k</i>, and from thence reflected to N and <i>n</i>, and from
  thence refracted toward P and <i>p</i>; therefore the Arch F<i>f</i> will
  be 5.<sup>d</sup> 5'. The Arch FK 106.<sup>d</sup> 30'. the Arch
  <i>fk</i> 101.<sup>d</sup> 2'. The line FG 6000. and <i>fg</i> 5267.
  therefore <i>hf</i>. 733. therefore F<i>c</i> 980, almost. The line FK
  16024. and <i>fk</i> 15436. therefore N<i>d</i> 196. and <i>no</i> 147
  almost, the line Nn 1019 the Arch N<i>n</i> 5.<sup>d</sup> 51'. therefore
  the Angle N<i>no</i> is 34.<sup>d</sup> 43'. therefore the Angle
  N<i>on</i> is 139.<sup>d</sup> 56'. which is almost 50.<sup>d</sup> more
  than a right Angle.</p>

  <p>It is evident therefore by this <i>Hypothesis</i>, that at the same
  time that <i>ef</i> touches <i>f</i>. EF is arrived at <i>c</i>. And by
  that time <i>efkn</i> is got to <i>n</i>, EFKN is got to <i>d</i> and
  when it touches N, the pulse of the other Ray is got to <i>o</i>. and no
  farther, which is very short of the place it should have arriv'd to, to
  make the Ray <i>np</i> to cut the <i>orbicular pulse</i> N<i>o</i> at
  right Angles: therefore the Angle N<i>op</i> is an acute Angle, but the
  quite contrary of this will happen, if 17. and 18. be
  calculated in stead of 16. and 17. both which does most exactly agree
  with the <i>Phænomena</i>: For if the Sun, or a Candle (which is better)
  be placed about E<i>e</i>, and the eye about P<i>p</i>, the Rays
  EF<i>ef</i> at 16. and 17. will paint the side of the luminous object
  toward <i>np</i> <i>Blue</i>, and towards NP <i>Red</i>. But the quite
  contrary will happen when EF is 17. and <i>ef</i> 18. for then towards NP
  shall be a <i>Blue</i>, and towards <i>np</i> a <i>Red</i>, exactly
  according to the calculation. And there appears the <i>Blue</i> of the
  Rainbow, where the two <i>Blue</i> sides of the two Images unite, and
  there the <i>Red</i> where the two <i>Red</i> sides unite, that is, where
  the two Images are just disappearing; which is, when the Rays EF and NP
  produc'd till they meet, make an Angle of about 41. and an half; the like
  union is there of the two Images in the Production of the <i>Secundary
  Iris</i>, and the same causes, as upon calculation may appear; onely with
  this difference, that it is somewhat more faint, by reason of the
  duplicate reflection, which does always weaken the impulse the oftner it
  is repeated.</p>

  <p>Now, though the second refraction made at N<i>n</i> be convenient,
  that is, do make the Rays glance the more, yet is it not altogether
  requisite; for it is plain from the calculation, that the pulse <i>dn</i>
  is sufficiently <i>oblique</i> to the Rays KN and <i>kn</i>, as wel as
  the pulse <i>fc</i> is <i>oblique</i> to the Rays FK &amp; <i>fk</i>. And
  therefore if a piece of very fine Paper be held close against N<i>n</i>
  and the eye look on it either through the Ball as from D, or from the
  other side, as from B. there shall appear a Rainbow, or colour'd line
  painted on it with the part toward X appearing <i>Red</i>, towards O,
  <i>Blue</i>; the same also shall happen, if the Paper be placed about
  K<i>k</i>, for towards T shall appear a <i>Red</i>, and towards V a
  <i>Blue</i>, which does exactly agree with this my <i>Hypothesis</i>, as
  upon the calculation of the progress of the pulse will most easily
  appear.</p>

  <p>Nor do these two observations of the colours appearing to the eye
  about <i>p</i> differing from what they appear on the Paper at N
  contradict each other; but rather confirm and exactly agree with one
  another, as will be evident to him that examines the reasons set down by
  the ingenious. <i>Des Cartes</i> in the 12. <i>Sect.</i> of the 8.
  <i>Chapter of his Meteors</i>, where he gives the true reason why the
  colours appear of a quite contrary order to the eye, to what they
  appear'd on the Paper if the eye be plac'd in steed of the Paper: And as
  in the Prisme, so also in the Water-drop, or Globe the <i>Phænomena</i>,
  and reason are much the same.</p>

  <p>Having therefore shewn that there is such a propriety in the
  <i>prisme</i> and water <i>Globule</i> whereby the pulse is made
  <i>oblique</i> to the progressive, and that so much the more, by how much
  greater the refraction is, I shall in the next place consider, how this
  conduces to the production of colours, and what kind of impression it
  makes upon the bottom of the eye; and to this end it will be requisite to
  examine this <i>Hypothesis</i> a little more particularly.</p>

  <p>First therefore, if we consider the manner of the progress of the
  pulse, it will seem rational to conclude, that that part or end of the
  pulse which precedes the other, must necessarily be somwhat more
  <i>obtunded</i>, or <i>impeded</i> by the
  resistance of the transparent <i>medium</i>, than the other part or end
  of it which is subsequent, whose way is, as it were, prepared by the
  other; especially if the adjacent <i>medium</i> be not in the same manner
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-06.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 6.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 4.
</span>
  enlightned or agitated. And therefore (in the fourth <i>Figure</i> of the
  sixth <i>Iconism</i>) the Ray AAAHB will have its side HH more deadned by
  the resistance of the dark or quiet <i>medium</i> PPP, Whence there will
  be a kind of deadness superinduc'd on the side HHH, which will
  continually increase from B, and strike deeper and deeper into the Ray by
  the line BR; Whence all the parts of the triangle, RBHO will be of a dead
  <i>Blue</i> colour, and so much the deeper, by how much the nearer they
  lie to the line BHH, which is most deaded or impeded, and so much the
  more <i>dilute</i>, by how much the nearer it approaches the line BR.
  Next on the other side of the Ray AAN, the end A of the pulse AH will be
  promoted, or made stronger, having its passage already prepar'd as 'twere
  by the other parts preceding, and so its impression wil be stronger; And
  because of its <i>obliquity</i> to the Ray, there will be propagated a
  kind of faint motion into QQ the adjacent dark or quiet <i>medium</i>,
  which faint motion will spread further and further into QQ as the Ray is
  propagated further and further from A, namely, as far as the line MA,
  whence all the triangle MAN will be ting'd with a <i>Red</i>, and that
  <i>Red</i> will be the deeper the nearer it approaches the line MA, and
  the <i>paler</i> or <i>yellower</i> the nearer it is the line NA. And if
  the Ray be continued, so that the lines AN and BR (which are the bounds
  of the <i>Red</i> and <i>Blue diluted</i>) do meet and cross each other,
  there will be beyond that intersection generated all kinds of
  <i>Greens</i>.</p>

  <p>Now, these being the proprieties of every single refracted Ray of
  light, it will be easie enough to consider what must be the result of
  very many such Rays collateral: As if we suppose infinite such Rays
  <i>interjacent</i> between AKSB and ANOB, which arc the terminating: For
  in this case the Ray AKSB will have its <i>Red</i> triangle intire, as
  lying next to the dark or quiet <i>medium</i>, but the other side of it
  BS will have no <i>Blue</i>, because the <i>medium adjacent</i> to it
  SBO, is mov'd or enlightned, and consequently that light does destroy the
  colour. So likewise will the Ray ANOB lose its <i>Red</i>, because the
  <i>adjacent medium</i> is mov'd or enlightned, but the other side of the
  Ray that is <i>adjacent</i> to the dark, namely, AHO will preserve its
  <i>Blue</i> entire, and these Rays must be so far produc'd as till AN and
  BR cut each other, before there will be any <i>Green</i> produc'd. From
  these Proprieties well consider'd, may be deduc'd the reasons of all the
  <i>Phænomena</i> of the <i>prisme</i>, and of the <i>Globules</i> or
  drops of Water which conduce to the production of the Rainbow.</p>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-06.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 6.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 5.
</span>
  <p>Next for the impression they make on the <i>Retina</i>, we will
  further examine this <i>Hypothesis</i>: Suppose therefore ABCDEF, in the
  fifth <i>Figure</i>, to represent the Ball of the eye: on the
  <i>Cornea</i> of which ABC two Rays GACH and KCAI (which are the
  terminating Rays of a luminous body) falling, are by the refraction
  thereof collected or <i>converg'd</i> into two points at the bottom of
  the eye. Now, because these terminating Rays, and all the
  <i>intermediate</i> ones which come from any part of the luminous body,
  are suppos'd by some sufficient refraction before they
  enter the eye, to have their pulses made <i>oblique</i> to their
  progression, and consequently each Ray to have potentially
  <i>superinduc'd</i> two proprieties, or colours, viz., a <i>Red</i> on
  the one side, and a <i>Blue</i> on the other, which notwithstanding are
  never actually manifest, but when this or that Ray has the one or the
  other side of it bordering on a dark or unmov'd <i>medium</i>, therefore
  as soon as these Rays are entred into the eye and so have one side of
  each of them bordering on a dark part of the humours of the eye, they
  will each of them actually exhibit some colour; therefore ADC the
  production of GACH will exhibit a <i>Blue</i>, because the side CD is
  <i>adjacent</i> to the dark <i>medium</i> CQDC, but nothing of a
  <i>Red</i>, because its side AD is <i>adjacent</i> to the enlightned
  <i>medium</i> ADFA: And all the Rays that from the points of the luminous
  body are collected on the parts of the <i>Retina</i> between D and F
  shall have their <i>Blue</i> so much the more <i>diluted</i> by how much
  the farther these points of collection are distant from D towards F; and
  the Ray AFC the production of KCAI, will exhibit a <i>Red</i>, because
  the side AF is adjacent to the dark or quiet <i>medium</i> of the eye
  APFA, but nothing of a <i>Blue</i>, because its side CF is
  <i>adjacent</i> to the enlightned <i>medium</i> CFDC, and all the Rays
  from the intermediate parts of the luminous body that are collected
  between F and D shall have their <i>Red</i> so much the more diluted, by
  how much the farther they are distant from F towards D.</p>

  <p>Now, because by the refraction in the <i>Cornea</i>, and some other
  parts of the eye, the sides of each Ray, which before were almost
  parallel, are made to <i>converge</i> and meet in a point at the bottom
  of the eye, therefore that side of the <i>pulse</i> which preceded before
  these refractions, shall first touch the <i>Retina</i>, and the other
  side last. And therefore according as this or that side, or end of the
  pulse shall be impeded, accordingly will the <i>impressions</i> on the
  <i>Retina</i> be varied; therefore by the Ray GACH refracted by the
  <i>Cornea</i> to D there shall be on that point a stroke or impression
  confus'd, whose weakest end, namely, that by the line CD shall precede,
  and the stronger, namely, that by the line AD shall follow. And by the
  Ray KCAI refracted to F, there shall be on that part a confus'd stroke or
  impression, whose strongest part, namely, that by the line CF shal
  precede, and whose weakest or impeded, namely, that by the line AF shall
  follow, and all the intermediate points between F and D will receive
  impressions from the <i>converg'd</i> Rays so much the more like the
  impressions on F and D by how much the nearer they approach that or
  this.</p>

  <p>From the consideration of the proprieties of which impressions, we may
  collect these short definitions of Colours: That <i>Blue is an impression
  on the Retina of an oblique and confus'd pulse of light, whose weakest
  part precedes, and whose strongest follows.</i> And, that <i>Red is an
  impression on the Retina of an oblique and confus'd pulse of light, whose
  strongest part precedes, and whose weakest follows.</i></p>

  <p>Which proprieties, as they have been already manifested, in the Prisme
  and falling drops of Rain, to be the causes of the colours there
  generated, may be easily found to be the efficients also of the colours
  appearing in thin <i>laminated</i> transparent bodies; for the
  explication of which, all this has been premised.</p>

  <p>And that this is so, a little closer examination of the
  <i>Phænomena</i> and the <i>Figure</i> of the body, by this
  <i>Hypothesis</i> will make evident.</p>

  <p>For first (as we have already observed) the <i>laminated</i> body must
  be of a determinate thickness, that is, it must not be thinner then such
  a determinate quantity; for I have always observ'd, that neer the edges
  of those which are exceeding thin, the colours disappear, and the part
  grows white; nor must it be thicker then another determinate quantity;
  for I have likewise observ'd, that beyond such a thickness, no colours
  appear'd, but the Plate looked white, between which two determinate
  thicknesses were all the colour'd Rings; of which in some substances I
  have found ten or twelve, in others not half so many, which I suppose
  depends much upon the transparency of the <i>laminated</i> body. Thus
  though the consecutions are the same in the scumm or the skin on the top
  of metals; yet in those consecutions in the same colour is not so often
  repeated as in the consecutions in thin Glass, or in Sope-water, or any
  other more transparent and glutinous liquor; for in these I have
  observ'd, <i>Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple; Red, Yellow, Green, Blue,
  Purple; Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple; Red, Yellow, &amp;c.</i> to
  succeed each other, ten or twelve times, but in the other more
  <i>opacous</i> bodies the consecutions will not be half so many.</p>

  <p>And therefore secondly, the <i>laminated</i> body must be transparent,
  and this I argue from this, that I have not been able to produce any
  colour at all with an <i>opacous</i> body, though never so thin. And this
  I have often try'd, by pressing small <i>Globule</i> of <i>Mercury</i>
  between two smooth Plates of Glass, whereby I have reduc'd that body to a
  much greater thinness then was requisite to exhibit the colours with a
  transparent body.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, there must be a considerable reflecting body adjacent to the
  under or further side of the <i>lamina</i> or <i>plate</i>: for this I
  always found, that the greater that reflection was, the more vivid were
  the appearing colours.</p>

  <p>From which Observations, is most evident, that the reflection from the
  under or further side of the body is the principal cause of the
  production of these colours; which, that it is so, and how it conduces to
  that effect, I shall further explain in the following Figure, which is
  here described of a very great thickness, as if it had been view'd
  through the <i>Microscope</i>; and 'tis indeed much thicker than any
  <i>Microscope</i> (I have yet us'd) has been able to shew me those
  colour'd plates of Glass, or <i>Muscovie-glass</i>, which I have not
  without much trouble view'd with it, for though I have endeavoured to
  magnifie them as much as the Glasses were capable of, yet are they so
  exceeding thin, that I have not hitherto been able positively to
  determine their thickness. This Figure therefore I here represent, is
  wholy <i>Hypothetical</i>.</p>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-06.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 6.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 6.
</span>
  <p>Let ABCDHFE in the sixth Figure be a <i>frustum</i> of
  <i>Muscovy-glass</i>, thinner toward the end AE, and thicker towards DF.
  Let us first suppose the Ray <i>aghb</i> coming from the Sun, of some
  remote luminous object to fall <i>obliquely</i> on the thinner plate BAE,
  part therefore is reflected back by <i>cghd</i>, the first
  <i>Superficies</i>; whereby the perpendicular pulse
  <i>ab</i> is after reflexion propagated by <i>cd</i>, <i>cd</i>, equally
  remote from each other with <i>ab</i>, <i>ab</i>, so that <i>ag</i> +
  <i>gc</i>, or <i>bh</i> + <i>hd</i> are either of them equal to
  <i>aa</i>, as is also <i>cc</i>, but the body BAE being transparent, a
  part of the light of this Ray is refracted in the surface AB, and
  propagated by <i>gikh</i> to the surface EF, whence it is reflected and
  refracted again by the surface AB. So that after two refractions and one
  reflection, there is propagated a kind of fainter Ray <i>emnf</i>, whose
  pulse is not only weaker by reason of the two refractions in the surface
  AB, but by reason of the time spent in passing and repassing between the
  two surfaces AB and EF, <i>ef</i> which is this fainter or weaker pulse
  comes behind the pulse <i>cd</i>; so that hereby (the surfaces AB, and EF
  being so neer together, that the eye cannot <i>discriminate</i> them from
  one) this confus'd or <i>duplicated</i> pulse, whose strongest part
  precedes, and whose weakest follows, does produce on the <i>Retina</i>,
  (or the <i>optick nerve</i> that covers the bottom of the eye) the
  sensation of a <i>Yellow</i>.</p>

  <p>And secondly, this <i>Yellow</i> will appear so much the deeper, by
  how much the further back towards the middle between <i>cd</i> and
  <i>cd</i> the spurious pulse <i>ef</i> is remov'd, as in 2 where the
  surface BC being further remov'd from EF, the weaker pulse <i>ef</i> will
  be nearer to the middle, and will make an impression on the eye of a
  <i>Red</i>.</p>

  <p>But thirdly, if the two reflecting surfaces be yet further remov'd
  asunder (as in 3 CD and EF are) then will the weaker pulse be so farr
  behind, that it will be more then half the distance between <i>cd</i> and
  <i>cd</i>. And in this case it will rather seem to precede the following
  stronger pulse, then to follow the preceding one, and consequently a
  <i>Blue</i> will be generated. And when the weaker pulse is just in the
  middle between two strong ones, then is a deep and lovely <i>Purple</i>
  generated; but when the weaker pulse <i>ef</i> is very neer to <i>cd</i>,
  then is there generated a <i>Green</i>, which will be <i>bluer</i>, or
  <i>yellower</i>, according as the <i>approximate</i> weak pulse does
  precede or follow the stronger.</p>

  <p>Now fourthly, if the thicker Plate chance to be cleft into two thinner
  Plates, as CDFE is divided into two Plates by the surface GH then from
  the composition arising from the three reflections in the surfaces CD,
  GH, and EF, there will be generated several compounded or mixt colours,
  which will be very differing, according as the proportion between the
  thicknesses of those two divided Plates CDHG, and GHFE are varied.</p>

  <p>And <i>fifthly</i>, if these surfaces CD and FE are further remov'd
  asunder, the weaker pulse will yet lagg behind much further, and not
  onely be <i>coincident</i> with the second, <i>cd</i>, but lagg behind
  that also, and that so much the more, by how much the thicker the Plate
  be; so that by degrees it will be <i>coincident</i> with the third
  <i>cd</i> backward also, and by degrees, as the Plate grows thicker with
  a fourth, and so onward to a fifth, sixth, seventh, or eighth; so that if
  there be a thin transparent body, that from the greatest thinness
  requisite to produce colours, does, in the manner of a Wedge, by degrees
  grow to the greatest thickness that a Plate can be of, to exhibit a
  colour by the reflection of Light from such a body, there
  shall be generated several consecutions of colours, whose order from the
  thin end towards the thick, shall be <i>Yellow, Red, Purple, Blue, Green;
  Yellow, Red, Purple, Blue, Green; Yellow, Red, Purple, Blue, Green;
  Yellow</i>, &amp;c. and these so often repeated, as the weaker pulse does
  lose paces with its <i>Primary</i>, or first pulse, and is
  <i>coincident</i> with a second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth,
  <i>&amp;c.</i> pulse behind the first. And this, as it is
  <i>coincident</i>, or follows from the first <i>Hypothesis</i> I took of
  colours, so upon experiment have I found it in multitudes of instances
  that seem to prove it. One thing which seems of the greatest concern in
  this <i>Hypothesis</i>, is to determine the greatest or least thickness
  requisite for these effects, which, though I have not been wanting in
  attempting, yet so exceeding thin are these coloured Plates, and so
  imperfect our <i>Microscope</i>, that I have not been hitherto
  successfull, though if my endeavours shall answer my expectations, I
  shall hope to gratifie the curious Reader with some things more remov'd
  beyond our reach hitherto.</p>

  <p>Thus have I, with as much brevity as I was able, endeavoured to
  explicate (<i>Hypothetically</i> at least) the causes of the
  <i>Phænomena</i> I formerly recited, on the consideration of which I have
  been the more particular.</p>

  <p>First, because I think these I have newly given are capable of
  explicating all the <i>Phænomena</i> of colours, not onely of those
  appearing in the <i>Prisme</i>, Water-drop, or Rainbow, and in
  <i>laminated</i> or plated bodies, but of all that are in the world,
  whether they be fluid or solid bodies, whether in thick or thin, whether
  transparent, or seemingly opacous, as I shall in the next Observation
  further endeavour to shew. And secondly, because this being one of the
  two ornaments of all bodies discoverable by the sight, whether looked on
  with, or without a <i>Microscope</i>, it seem'd to deserve (somewhere in
  this Tract, which contains a description of the Figure and Colour of some
  minute bodies) to be somewhat the more intimately enquir'd into.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsX" id="obsX">X</a>. <i>Of </i>Metalline<i>, and other real Colours.</i></h3>

  <p>Having in the former Discourse, from the Fundamental cause of Colour,
  made it probable, that there are but two Colours, and shewn, that the
  <i>Phantasm</i> of Colour is caus'd by the sensation of the
  <i>oblique</i> or uneven pulse of Light which is capable of no more
  varieties than two that arise from the two sides of the <i>oblique</i>
  pulse, though each of those be capable of infinite gradations or degrees
  (each of them beginning from <i>White</i>, and ending the one in the
  deepest <i>Scarlet</i> or <i>Yellow</i>, the other in the deepest
  <i>Blue</i>) I shall in this <i>Section</i> set down some Observations
  which I have made of other colours, such as <i>Metalline</i> powders
  tinging or colour'd bodies and several kinds of tinctures or ting'd
  liquors, all which, together with those I treated of in the former
  Observation will, I suppose, comprise the several subjects in which
  colour is observ'd to be inherent, and the several manners by which it
  <i>inheres</i>, or is apparent in them. And here I shall
  endeavour to shew by what composition all kind of compound colours are
  made, and how there is no colour in the world but may be made from the
  various degrees of these two colours, together with the intermixtures of
  <i>Black</i> and <i>White</i>.</p>

  <p>And this being so, as I shall anon shew, it seems an evident argument
  to me, that all colours whatsoever, whether in fluid or solid, whether in
  very transparent or seemingly <i>opacous</i>, have the same efficient
  cause, to wit, some kind of <i>refraction</i> whereby the Rays that
  proceed from such bodies, have their pulse <i>obliquated</i> or confus'd
  in the manner I explicated in the former <i>Section</i>; that is, a
  <i>Red</i> is caus'd by a duplicated or confus'd pulse, whose strongest
  pulse precedes, and a weaker follows: and a <i>Blue</i> is caus'd by a
  confus'd pulse, where the weaker pulse precedes, and the stronger
  follows. And according as these are, more or less, or variously mixt and
  compounded, so are the <i>sensations</i>, and consequently the
  <i>phantasms</i> of colours <i>diversified</i>.</p>

  <p>To proceed therefore; I suppose, that all transparent colour'd bodies,
  whether fluid or solid, do consist at least of two parts, or two kinds of
  substances, the one of a substance of a somewhat differing
  <i>refraction</i> from the other. That one of these substances which may
  be call'd the <i>tinging</i> substance, does consist of distinct parts,
  or particles of a determinate bigness which are <i>disseminated</i>, or
  dispers'd all over the other: That these particles, if the body be
  equally and uniformly colour'd, are evenly rang'd and dispers'd over the
  other contiguous body; That where the body is deepest ting'd, there these
  particles are rang'd thickest, and where 'tis but faintly ting'd, they
  are rang'd much thinner, but uniformly. That by the mixture of another
  body that unites with either of these, which has a differing refraction
  from either of the other, quite differing effects will be produc'd, that
  is, the <i>consecutions</i> of the confus'd pulses will be much of
  another kind, and consequently produce other <i>sensations</i> and
  <i>phantasms</i> of colours, and from a <i>Red</i> may turn to a
  <i>Blue</i>, or from a <i>Blue</i> to a <i>Red</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Now, that this may be the better understood, I shall endeavour to
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-06.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 6.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 7.
</span>
  explain my meaning a little more sensible by a <i>Scheme</i>: Suppose we
  therefore in the seventh <i>Figure</i> of the sixth <i>Scheme</i>, that
  ABCD represents a Vessel holding a ting'd liquor, let IIIII, &amp;c. be
  the clear liquor, and let the tinging body that is mixt with it be EE,
  <i>&amp;c.</i> FF, <i>&amp;c.</i> GG, <i>&amp;c.</i> HH, <i>&amp;c.</i>
  whose particles (whether round, or some other determinate Figure is
  little to our purpose) are first of a determinate and equal bulk. Next,
  they are rang'd into the form of <i>Quincunx</i>, or
  <i>Equilaterotriangular</i> order, which that probably they are so, and
  why they are so, I shall elsewhere endeavour to shew. Thirdly, they are
  of such a nature, as does either more easily or more difficultly transmit
  the Rays of light then the liquor; if more easily, a <i>Blue</i> is
  generated, and if more difficultly, a <i>Red</i> or <i>Scarlet</i>.</p>

  <p>And first, let us suppose the tinging particles to be of a substance
  that does more <i>impede</i> the Rays of light, we shall find that the
  pulse or wave of light mov'd from AD to BC, will proceed on, through the
  containing <i>medium</i> by the pulses or waves KK, LL, MM, NN, OO; but
  because several of these Rays that go to the
  constitution of these pulses will be slugged or stopped by the tinging
  particles E, F, G, H; therefore there shall be <i>secundary</i> and weak
  pulse that shall follow the Ray, namely PP which will be the weaker:
  first, because it has suffer'd many refractions in the impeding body;
  next, for that the Rays will be a little dispers'd or confus'd by reason
  of the refraction in each of the particles, whether <i>round</i> or
  <i>angular</i>; and this will be more evident, if we a little more
  closely examine any one particular tinging <i>Globule</i>.</p>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-06.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 6.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 8.
</span>
  <p>Suppose we therefore AB in the eighth <i>Figure</i> of the sixth
  <i>Scheme</i>, to represent a tinging <i>Globule</i> or particle which
  has a greater refraction than the liquor in which it is contain'd: Let CD
  be a part of the pulse of light which is <i>propagated</i> through the
  containing <i>medium</i>; this pulse will be a little stopt or impeded by
  the <i>Globule</i>, and so by that time the pulse is past to EF that part
  of it which has been impeded by passing through the <i>Globule</i>, will
  get but to LM, and so that pulse which has been <i>propagated</i> through
  the <i>Globule</i>, to wit, LM, NO, PQ, will always come behind the
  pulses EF, GH, IK, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>Next, by reason of the greater impediment in AB, and its
  <i>Globular</i> Figure, the Rays that pass through it will be dispers'd,
  and very much scatter'd. Whence CA and DB which before went <i>direct</i>
  and <i>parallel</i>, will after the refraction in AB, <i>diverge</i> and
  spread by AP, and BQ; so that as the Rays do meet with more and more of
  these tinging particles in their way, by so much the more will the pulse
  of light further lagg behind the clearer pulse, or that which has fewer
  refractions, and thence the deeper will the colour be, and the fainter
  the light that is trajected through it; for not onely many Rays are
  reflected from the surfaces of AB, but those Rays that get through it are
  very much disordered.</p>

  <p>By this <i>Hypothesis</i> there is no one experiment of colour that I
  have yet met with, but may be, I conceive, very rationably solv'd, and
  perhaps, had I time to examine several particulars requisite to the
  demonstration of it, I might prove it more than probable, for all the
  experiments about the changes and mixings of colours related in the
  Treatise of Colours, published by the <i>Incomparable</i> Mr.
  <i>Boyle</i>, and multitudes of others which I have observ'd, do so
  easily and naturally flow from those principles, that I am very apt to
  think it probable, that they own their production to no other
  <i>secundary</i> cause: As to instance in two or three experiments. In
  the twentieth Experiment, this <i>Noble Authour</i> has shewn that the
  deep <i>bluish purple-colour</i> of <i>Violets</i>, may be turn'd into a
  <i>Green</i>, by <i>Alcalizate Salts</i>, and to a <i>Red</i> by acid;
  that is, a <i>Purple</i> consists of two colours, a deep <i>Red</i>, and
  a deep <i>Blue</i>; when the <i>Blue</i> is diluted, or altered, or
  destroy'd by <i>acid Salts</i>, the <i>Red</i> becomes predominant, but
  when the <i>Red</i> is diluted by <i>Alcalizate</i>, and the <i>Blue</i>
  heightned, there is generated a <i>Green</i>; for of a <i>Red</i>
  diluted, is made a <i>Yellow</i>, and <i>Yellow</i> and <i>Blue</i> make
  a <i>Green</i>.</p>

  <p>Now, because the <i>spurious</i> pulses which cause a <i>Red</i> and a
  <i>Blue</i>, do the one follow the clear pulse, and the other precede it,
  it usually follows, that those <i>Saline</i> refracting bodies which do
  <i>dilute</i> the colour of the one, do deepen that of the other. And
  this will be made manifest by almost all kinds of
  <i>Purples</i>, and many sorts of <i>Greens</i>, both these colours
  consisting of mixt colours; for if we suppose A and A in the ninth
  Figure, to represent two pulses of clear light, which follow each other
  at a convenient distance, AA, each of which has a <i>spurious</i> pulse
  preceding it, as BB, which makes a <i>Blue</i>, and another following it,
  as CC, which makes a <i>Red</i>, the one caus'd by tinging particles that
  have a greater refraction, the other by others that have a less
  refracting quality then the liquor or <i>Menstruum</i> in which these are
  dissolv'd, whatsoever liquor does so alter the refraction of the one,
  without altering that of the other part of the ting'd liquor, must needs
  very much alter the colour of the liquor; for if the refraction of the
  <i>dissolvent</i> be increas'd, and the refraction of the tinging
  particles not altered, then will the preceding <i>spurious</i> pulse be
  shortned or stopt, and not out-run the clear pulse so much; so that BB
  will become EE, and the <i>Blue</i> be <i>diluted</i>, whereas the other
  <i>spurious</i> pulse which follows will be made to lagg much more, and
  be further behind AA than before, and CC will become <i>ff</i>, and so
  the <i>Yellow</i> or <i>Red</i> will be heightned.</p>

  <p>A <i>Saline</i> liquor therefore, mixt with another ting'd liquor, may
  alter the colour of it several ways, either by altering the refraction of
  the liquor in which the colour swims: or secondly by varying the
  refraction of the coloured particles, by uniting more intimately either
  with some particular <i>corpuscles</i> of the tinging body, or with all
  of them, according as it has a <i>congruity</i> to some more especially,
  or to all alike: or thirdly, by uniting and interweaving it self with
  some other body that is already joyn'd with the tinging particles, with
  which substance it may have a <i>congruity</i>, though it have very
  little with the particles themselves: or fourthly, it may alter the
  colour of a ting'd liquor by dis-joyning certain particles which were
  before united with the tinging particles, which though they were somewhat
  <i>congruous</i> to these particles, have yet a greater <i>congruity</i>
  with the newly <i>infus'd Saline menstruum</i>. It may likewise alter the
  colour by further dissolving the tinging substance into smaller and
  smaller <i>particles</i>, and so <i>diluting</i> the colour; or by
  uniting several <i>particles</i> together as in precipitations, and so
  deepning it, and some such other ways, which many experiments and
  comparisons of differing trials together, might easily inform one of.</p>

  <p>From these Principles applied, may be made out all the varieties of
  colours observable, either in liquors, or any other ting'd bodies, with
  great ease, and I hope intelligible enough, there being nothing in the
  <i>notion</i> of colour, or in the suppos'd production, but is very
  conceivable, and may be possible.</p>

  <p>The greatest difficulty that I find against this <i>Hypothesis</i>,
  is, that there seem to be more distinct colours then two, that is, then
  Yellow and Blue. This Objection is grounded on this reason, that there
  are several Reds, which <i>diluted</i>, make not a Saffron or pale
  Yellow, and therefore Red, or Scarlet seems to be a third colour distinct
  from a deep degree of Yellow.</p>

  <p>To which I answer, that Saffron affords us a deep Scarlet tincture,
  which may be <i>diluted</i> into as pale a Yellow as any, either by
  making a weak solution of the Saffron, by infusing a
  small parcel of it into a great quantity of liquor, as in spirit of Wine,
  or else by looking through a very thin quantity of the tincture, and
  which may be heightn'd into the loveliest Scarlet, by looking through a
  very thick body of this tincture, or through a thinner parcel of it,
  which is highly <i>impregnated</i> with the tinging body, by having had a
  greater quantity of the Saffron dissolv'd in a smaller parcel of the
  liquor.</p>

  <p>Now, though there may be some particles of other tinging bodies that
  give a lovely Scarlet also, which though <i>diluted</i> never so much
  with liquor, or looked on through never so thin a parcel of ting'd
  liquor, will not yet afford a pale Yellow, but onely a kind of faint Red;
  yet this is no argument but that those ting'd particles may have in them
  the faintest degree of Yellow, though we may be unable to make them
  exhibit it; For that power of being <i>diluted</i> depending upon the
  divisibility of the ting'd body, if I am unable to make the tinging
  particles so thin as to exhibit that colour, it does not therefore
  follow, that the thing is impossible to be done; now, the tinging
  particles of some bodies are of such a nature, that unless there be found
  some way of comminuting them into less bulks then the liquor does
  dissolve them into, all the Rays that pass through them must necessarily
  receive a tincture so deep, as their appropriate refractions and bulks
  compar'd with the proprieties of the dissolving liquor must necessarily
  dispose them to empress, which may perhaps be a pretty deep Yellow, or
  pale Red.</p>

  <p>And that this is not <i>gratis dictum</i>, I shall add one instance of
  this kind, wherein the thing is most manifest.</p>

  <p>If you take Blue <i>Smalt</i>, you shall find, that to afford the
  deepest Blue, which <i>cæteris paribus</i> has the greatest particles or
  sands; and if you further divide, or grind those particles on a
  Grindstone, or <i>porphyry</i> stone, you may by <i>comminuting</i> the
  sands of it, <i>dilute</i> the Blue into as pale a one as you please,
  which you cannot do by laying the colour thin; for wheresoever any single
  particle is, it exhibits as deep a Blue as the whole mass. Now, there are
  other Blues, which though never so much ground, will not be
  <i>diluted</i> by grinding, because consisting of very small particles,
  very deeply ting'd, they cannot by grinding be actually separated into
  smaller particles then the operation of the fire, or some other
  dissolving <i>menstruum</i>, reduc'd them to already.</p>

  <p>Thus all kind of <i>Metalline</i> colours, whether
  <i>precipitated</i>, <i>sublim'd</i>, <i>calcin'd</i>, or otherwise
  prepar'd, are hardly chang'd by grinding, as <i>ultra marine</i> is not
  more <i>diluted</i>; nor is <i>Vermilion</i> or <i>Red-lead</i> made of a
  more faint colour by grinding; for the smallest particles of these which
  I have view'd with my greatest Magnifying-Glass, if they be well
  enlightned, appear very deeply ting'd with their peculiar colours; nor,
  though I have magnified and enlightned the particles exceedingly, could I
  in many of them, perceive them to be transparent, or to be whole
  particles, but the smallest specks that I could find among well ground
  <i>Vermilion</i> and <i>Red-lead</i>, seem'd to be a Red mass, compounded
  of a multitude of less and less motes, which sticking together, compos'd
  a bulk, not one thousand thousandth part of the smallest visible sand or
  mote.</p>

  <p>And this I find generally in most <i>Metalline</i> colours, that
  though they consist of parts so exceedingly small, yet are they very
  deeply ting'd, they being so ponderous, and having such a multitude of
  terrestrial particles throng'd into a little room; so that 'tis difficult
  to find any particle transparent or resembling a pretious stone, though
  not impossible; for I have observ'd divers such shining and resplendent
  colours intermixt with the particles of <i>Cinnaber</i>, both natural and
  artificial, before it hath been ground and broken or flaw'd into
  <i>Vermilion</i>: As I have also in <i>Orpiment</i>, <i>Red-lead</i>, and
  <i>Bise</i>, which makes me suppose, that those <i>metalline</i> colours
  are by grinding, not onely broken and separated actually into smaller
  pieces, but that they are also flaw'd and brused, whence they, for the
  most part, become <i>opacous</i>, like flaw'd Crystal or Glass,
  <i>&amp;c.</i> But for <i>Smalts</i> and <i>verditures</i>, I have been
  able with a <i>Microscope</i> to perceive their particles very many of
  them transparent.</p>

  <p>Now, that the others also may be transparent, though they do not
  appear so to the <i>Microscope</i>, may be made probable by this
  Experiment: that if you take <i>ammel</i> that is almost <i>opacous</i>,
  and grind it very well on a <i>Porphyry</i>, or <i>Serpentine</i>, the
  small particles will by reason of their flaws, appear perfectly
  <i>opacous</i>; and that 'tis the flaws that produce this
  <i>opacousness</i>, may be argued from this, that particles of the same
  <i>Ammel</i> much thicker if unflaw'd will appear somewhat transparent
  even to the eye; and from this also, that the most transparent and clear
  Crystal, if heated in the fire, and then suddenly quenched, so that it be
  all over flaw'd, will appear <i>opacous</i> and white.</p>

  <p>And that the particles of <i>Metalline</i> colours are transparent,
  may be argued yet further from this, that the Crystals, or
  <i>Vitriols</i> of all Metals, are transparent, which since they consist
  of <i>metalline</i> as well as <i>saline</i> particles, those
  <i>metalline</i> ones must be transparent, which is yet further confirm'd
  from this, that they have for the most part, <i>appropriate</i> colours;
  so the <i>vitriol</i> of Gold is Yellow; of Copper, Blue, and sometimes
  Green; of Iron, green; of Tinn and Lead, a pale White; of Silver, a pale
  Blue, <i>&amp;.</i></p>

  <p>And next, the <i>Solution</i> of all Metals into <i>menstruums</i> are
  much the same with the <i>Vitriols</i>, or Crystals. It seems therefore
  very probable, that those colours which are made by the
  <i>precipitation</i> of those particles out of the <i>menstruums</i> by
  transparent <i>precipitating</i> liquors should be transparent also. Thus
  Gold <i>precipitates</i> with <i>oyl of Tartar</i>, or <i>spirit of
  Urine</i> into a brown Yellow, Copper with spirit of <i>Urine</i> into a
  Mucous blue, which retains its transparency. A solution of sublimate (as
  the same Illustrious Authour I lately mention'd shews in his 40.
  Experiment) <i>precipitates</i> with oyl of <i>Tartar</i> <i>per
  deliquium</i>, into an Orange colour'd <i>precipitate</i>; nor is it less
  probable, that the <i>calcination</i> of those <i>Vitriols</i> by the
  fire, should have their particles transparent: Thus <i>Saccarum
  Saturni</i>, or the <i>Vitriol of Lead</i> by <i>calcination</i> becomes
  a deep Orange-colour'd <i>minium</i>, which is a kind of
  <i>precipitation</i> by some Salt which proceeds from the fire; common
  <i>Vitriol</i> <i>calcin'd</i>, yields a deep Brown Red, etc.</p>

  <p>A third Argument, that the particles of Metals are transparent, is,
  that being <i>calcin'd</i>, and melted with Glass, they tinge the Glass
  with transparent colours. Thus the <i>Calx</i> of Silver
  tinges the Glass on which it is anneal'd with a lovely Yellow, or Gold
  colour, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>And that the parts of Metals are transparent, may be farther argued
  from the transparency of Leaf-gold, which held against the light, both to
  the naked eye, and the <i>Microscope,</i> exhibits a deep Green. And
  though I have never seen the other Metals <i>laminated</i> so thin, that
  I was able to perceive them transparent, yet, for Copper and Brass, if we
  had the same conveniency for <i>laminating</i> them, as we have for Gold,
  we might, perhaps, through such plates or leaves, find very differing
  degrees of Blue, or Green; for it seems very probable, that those Rays
  that rebound from them ting'd, with a deep Yellow, or pale Red, as from
  Copper, or with a pale Yellow, as from Brass, have past through them; for
  I cannot conceive how by reflection alone those Rays can receive a
  tincture, taking any <i>Hypothesis</i> extant.</p>

  <p>So that we see there may a sufficient reason be drawn from these
  instances, why those colours which we are unable to <i>dilute</i> to the
  palest Yellow, or Blue, or Green, are not therefore to be concluded not
  to be a deeper degree of them; for supposing we had a great company of
  small <i>Globular</i> essence Bottles, or round Glass bubbles, about the
  bigness of a Walnut, fill'd each of them with a very deep mixture of
  Saffron, and that every one of them did appear of a deep Scarlet colour,
  and all of them together did <i>exhibit</i> at a distance, a deep dy'd
  Scarlet body. It does not follow, because after we have come nearer to
  this <i>congeries</i>, or mass, and divided it into its parts, and
  examining each of its parts severally or apart, we find them to have much
  the same colour with the whole mats; it does not, I say, therefore
  follow, that if we could break those <i>Globules</i> smaller, or any
  other ways come to see a smaller or thinner parcel of the ting'd liquor
  that fill'd those bubbles, that that ting'd liquor must always appear
  Red, or of a Scarlet hue, since if Experiment be made, the quite contrary
  will ensue; for it is capable of being <i>diluted</i> into the palest
  Yellow.</p>

  <p>Now, that I might avoid all the Objections of this kind, by exhibiting
  an Experiment that might by ocular proof convince those whom other
  reasons would not prevail with, I provided me a <i>Prismatical Glass</i>,
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-06.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 6.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 10.
</span>
  made hollow, just in the form of a Wedge, such as is represented in the
  tenth <i>Figure</i> of the sixth <i>Scheme</i>. The two
  <i>parallelogram</i> sides ABCD, ABEF, which met at a point, were made of
  the clearest Looking-glass plates well ground and polish'd that I could
  get; these were joyn'd with hard cement to the <i>triangular</i> sides,
  BCE, ADF, which were of Wood; the <i>Parallelogram</i> base BCEF,
  likewise was of Wood joyn'd on to the rest with hard cement, and the
  whole <i>Prismatical</i> Box was exactly stopt every where, but onely a
  little hole near the base was left, whereby the Vessel could be fill'd
  with any liquor, or emptied again at pleasure.</p>

  <p>One of these Boxes (for I had two of them) I fill'd with a pretty deep
  tincture of <i>Aloes</i>, drawn onely with fair Water, and then stopt the
  hole with a piece of Wax, then, by holding this Wedge against the Light,
  and looking through it, it was obvious enough to see the tincture of the
  liquor near the edge of the Wedge where it was but very thin, to be a
  pale but well colour'd Yellow, and further and further
  from the edge, as the liquor grew thicker and thicker, this tincture
  appear'd deeper and deeper, so that near the blunt end, which was seven
  Inches from the edge and three Inches and an half thick; it was of a deep
  and well colour'd Red. Now, the clearer and purer this tincture be, the
  more lovely will the deep Scarlet be, and the fouler the tincture be, the
  more dirty will the Red appear; so that some dirty tinctures have
  afforded their deepest Red much of the colour of burnt Oker or
  <i>Spanish</i> brown; others as lovely a colour as <i>Vermilion</i>, and
  some much brighter; but several others, according as the tinctures were
  worse or more foul, exhibited various kinds of Reds, of very differing
  degrees.</p>

  <p>The other of these Wedges, I fill'd with a most lovely tincture of
  Copper, drawn from the filings of it, with spirit of <i>Urine</i>, and
  this Wedge held as the former against the Light, afforded all manner of
  Blues, from the faintest to the deepest, so that I was in good hope by
  these two, to have produc'd all the varieties of colours imaginable; for
  I thought by this means to have been able by placing the two
  <i>Parallelogram</i> sides together, and the edges contrary ways, to have
  so mov'd them to and fro one by another, as by looking through them in
  several places, and through several thicknesses, I should have
  compounded, and consequently have seen all those colours, which by other
  like compositions of colours would have ensued.</p>

  <p>But insteed of meeting with what I look'd for, I met with somewhat
  more admirable; and that was, that I found my self utterly unable to see
  through them when placed both together, though they were transparent
  enough when asunder; and though I could see through twice the thickness,
  when both of them were fill'd with the same colour'd liquors, whether
  both with the Yellow, or both with the Blue, yet when one was fill'd with
  the Yellow, the other with the Blue, and both looked through, they both
  appear'd dark, onely when the parts near the tops were look'd through,
  they exhibited Greens, and those of very great variety, as I expected,
  but the Purples and other colours, I could not by any means make, whether
  I endeavour'd to look through them both against the Sun, or whether I
  plac'd them against the hole of a darkned room.</p>

  <p>But notwithstanding this mis-ghessing, I proceeded on with my trial in
  a dark room, and having two holes near one another, I was able, by
  placing my Wedges against them, to mix the ting'd Rays that past through
  them, and fell on a sheet of white Paper held at a convenient distance
  from them as I pleas'd; so that I could make the Paper appear of what
  colour I would, by varying the thicknesses of the Wedges, and
  consequently the tincture of the Rays that past through the two holes,
  and sometimes also by varying the Paper, that is, insteed of a white
  Paper, holding a gray, or a black piece of Paper.</p>

  <p>Whence I experimentally found what I had before imagin'd, that all the
  varieties of colours imaginable are produc'd from several degrees of
  these two colours, namely, Yellow and Blue, or the mixture of them with
  light and darkness, that is, white and black. And all those almost
  infinite varieties which Limners and Painters are able to make by
  compounding those several colours they lay on their Shels
  or <i>Palads</i>, are nothing else, but some <i>compositum</i>, made up
  of some one or more, or all of these four.</p>

  <p>Now, whereas it may here again be objected, that neither can the Reds
  be made out of the Yellows, added together, or laid on in greater or less
  quantity, nor can the Yellows be made out of the Reds though laid never
  so thin; and as for the addition of White or Black, they do nothing but
  either whiten or darken the colours to which they are added, and not at
  all make them of any other kind of colour: as for instance,
  <i>Vermilion</i>, by being temper'd with White Lead, does not at all grow
  more Yellow, but onely there is made a whiter kind of Red. Nor does
  Yellow <i>Oker</i>, though laid never so thick, produce the colour of
  <i>Vermilion</i>, nor though it be temper'd with Black, does it at all
  make a Red; nay, though it be temper'd with White, it will not afford a
  fainter kind of Yellow, such as <i>masticut</i>, but onely a whiten'd
  Yellow; nor will the Blues be <i>diluted</i> or deepned after the manner
  I speak of, as <i>Indico</i> will never afford so fine a Blue as
  <i>Ultramarine</i> or <i>Bise</i>; nor will it, temper'd with
  <i>Vermilion</i>, ever afford a Green, though each of them be never so
  much temper'd with white.</p>

  <p>To which I answer, that there is a great difference between
  <i>diluting</i> a colour and whitening of it; for <i>diluting</i> a
  colour, is to make the colour'd parts more thin, so that the ting'd
  light, which is made by trajecting those ting'd bodies, does not receive
  so deep a tincture; but whitening a colour is onely an intermixing of
  many clear reflections of light among the same ting'd parts; deepning
  also, and darkning or blacking a colour, are very different; for deepning
  a colour, is to make the light pass through a greater quantity of the
  same tinging body; and darkning or blacking a colour, is onely
  interposing a multitude of dark or black spots among the same ting'd
  parts, or placing the colour in a more faint light.</p>

  <p>First therefore, as to the former of these operations, that is,
  diluting and deepning, most of the colours us'd by the Limners and
  Painters are incapable of, to wit, <i>Vermilion</i> and <i>Red-lead</i>,
  and <i>Oker</i>, because the ting'd parts are so exceeding small, that
  the most curious Grindstones we have, are not able to separate them into
  parts actually divided so small as the ting'd particles are; for looking
  on the most curiously ground <i>Vermilion</i>, and <i>Oker</i>, and
  <i>Red-lead</i>, I could perceive that even those small <i>corpuscles</i>
  of the bodies they left were compounded of many pieces, that is, they
  seem'd to be small pieces compounded of a multitude of lesser ting'd
  parts: each piece seeming almost like a piece of Red Glass, or ting'd
  Crystal all flaw'd; so that unless the Grindstone could actually divide
  them into smaller pieces then those flaw'd particles were, which
  compounded that ting'd mote I could see with my <i>Microscope</i>, it
  would be impossible to <i>dilute</i> the colour by grinding, which,
  because the finest we have will not reach to do in <i>Vermilion</i> or
  <i>Oker</i>, therefore they cannot at all, or very hardly be
  <i>diluted</i>.</p>

  <p>Other colours indeed, whose ting'd particles are such as may be made
  smaller, by grinding their colour, may be <i>diluted</i>. Thus several of
  the Blues may be <i>diluted</i>, as <i>Smalt</i>
  and <i>Bise</i>; and <i>Masticut</i>, which is Yellow, may be made more
  faint: And even <i>Vermilion</i> it self may, by too much grinding, be
  brought to the colour of <i>Red-lead</i>, which is but an Orange colour,
  which is confest by all to be very much upon the Yellow. Now, though
  perhaps somewhat of this <i>diluting</i> of <i>Vermilion</i> by overmuch
  grinding may be attributed to the Grindstone, or muller, for that some of
  their parts may be worn off and mixt with the colour, yet there seems not
  very much, for I have done it on a Serpentine-stone with a muller made of
  a Pebble, and yet observ'd the same effect follow.</p>

  <p>And secondly, as to the other of these operations on colours, that is,
  the deepning of them, Limners and Painters colours are for the most part
  also uncapable. For they being for the most part <i>opacous</i>; and that
  <i>opacousness</i>, as I said before, proceeding from the particles,
  being very much flaw'd, unless we were able to joyn and re-unite those
  flaw'd particles again into one piece, we shall not be able to deepen the
  colour, which since we are unable to do with most of the colours which
  are by Painters accounted <i>opacous</i>, we are therefore unable to
  deepen them by adding more of the same kind.</p>

  <p>But because all those <i>opacous</i> colours have two kinds of beams
  or Rays reflected from them, that is, Rays unting'd, which are onely
  reflected from the outward surface, without at all penetrating of the
  body, and ting'd Rays which are reflected from the inward surfaces or
  flaws after they have suffer'd a two-fold refraction; and because that
  transparent liquors mixt with such <i>corpuscles</i>, do, for the most
  part, take off the former kind of reflection; therefore these colours
  mixt with Water or Oyl, appear much deeper than when dry, for most part
  of that white reflection from the outward surface is remov'd. Nay, some
  of these colours are very much deepned by the mixture with some
  transparent liquor, and that because they may perhaps get between those
  two flaws, and so consequently joyn two or more of those flaw'd pieces
  together; but this happens but in a very few.</p>

  <p>Now, to shew that all this is not <i>gratis dictum</i>, I shall set
  down some Experiments which do manifest these things to be probable and
  likely, which I have here deliver'd.</p>

  <p>For, first, if you take any ting'd liquor whatsoever, especially if it
  be pretty deeply ting'd, and by any means work it into a froth, the
  <i>congeries</i> of that froth shall seem an <i>opacous</i> body, and
  appear of the same colour, but much whiter than that of the liquor out of
  which it is made. For the abundance of reflections of the Rays against
  those surfaces of the bubbles of which the froth consists, does so often
  rebound the Rays backwards, that little or no light can pass through, and
  consequently the froth appears <i>opacous</i>.</p>

  <p>Again, if to any of these ting'd liquors that will endure the boiling
  there be added a small quantity of fine flower (the parts of which
  through the <i>Microscope</i> are plainly enough to be perceiv'd to
  consist of transparent <i>corpuscles</i>) and suffer'd to boyl till it
  thicken the liquor, the mass of the liquor will appear <i>opacous</i>,
  and ting'd with the same colour, but very much whiten'd.</p>

  <p>Thus, if you take a piece of transparent Glass that is well colour'd,
  and by heating it, and then quenching it in Water, you flaw it all over,
  it will become <i>opacous</i>, and will exhibit the same colour with
  which the piece is ting'd, but fainter and whiter.</p>

  <p>Or, if you take a Pipe of this transparent Glass, and in the flame of
  a Lamp melt it, and then blow it into very thin bubbles, then break those
  bubbles, and collect a good parcel of those <i>laminæ</i> together in a
  Paper, you shall find that a small thickness of those Plates will
  constitute an <i>opacous</i> body, and that you may see through the mass
  of Glass before it be thus <i>laminated</i>, above four times the
  thickness: And besides, they will now afford a colour by reflection as
  other <i>opacous</i> (as they are call'd) colours will, but much fainter
  and whiter than that of the Lump or Pipe out of which they were made.</p>

  <p>Thus also, if you take <i>Putty</i>, and melt it with any transparent
  colour'd Glass, it will make it become an <i>opacous</i> colour'd lump,
  and to yield a paler and whiter colour than the lump by reflection.</p>

  <p>The same thing may be done by a preparation of <i>Antimony</i>, as has
  been shewn by the Learned <i>Physician</i>, D<sup>r.</sup> <i>C.M.</i> in
  his Excellent Observations and Notes on <i>Nery's Art of Glass</i>; and
  by this means all transparent colours become <i>opacous</i>, or
  <i>ammels</i>. And though by being ground they lose very much of their
  colour, growing much whiter by reason of the multitude of single
  reflections from their outward surface, as I shew'd afore, yet the fire
  that in the nealing or melting re-unites them, and so renews those
  <i>spurious</i> reflections, removes also those whitenings of the colour
  that proceed from them.</p>

  <p>As for the other colours which Painters use, which are transparent,
  and us'd to varnish over all other paintings, 'tis well enough known that
  the laying on of them thinner or thicker, does very much <i>dilute</i> or
  deepen their colour.</p>

  <p>Painters Colours therefore consisting most of them of solid particles,
  so small that they cannot be either re-united into thicker particles by
  any Art yet known, and consequently cannot be deepned; or divided into
  particles so small as the flaw'd particles that exhibit that colour, much
  less into smaller, and consequently cannot be <i>diluted</i>; It is
  necessary that they which are to imitate all kinds of colours, should
  have as many degrees of each colour as can be procur'd.</p>

  <p>And to this purpose, both Limners and Painters have a very great
  variety both of Yellows and Blues, besides several other colour'd bodies
  that exhibit very compounded colours, such as Greens and Purples; and
  others that are compounded of several degrees of Yellow, or several
  degrees of Blue, sometimes unmixt, and sometimes compounded with several
  other colour'd bodies.</p>

  <p>The Yellows, from the palest to the deepest Red or Scarlet, which has
  no intermixture of Blue, are <i>pale and deep Masticut, Orpament, English
  Oker, brown Oker, Red Lead, and Vermilion, burnt English Oker, and burnt
  brown Oker,</i> which last have a mixture of dark or dirty parts with
  them, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>Their Blues are several kinds of <i>Smalts</i>, and <i>Verditures</i>,
  and <i>Bise</i>, and <i>Ultramarine</i>, and <i>Indico</i>, which last
  has many dirty or dark parts intermixt with it.</p>

  <p>Their compounded colour'd bodies, as <i>Pink</i>, and
  <i>Verdigrese</i>, which are Greens, the one a <i>Popingay</i>, the other
  a <i>Sea-green</i>; then <i>Lac</i>, which is a very lovely
  <i>Purple</i>.</p>

  <p>To which may be added their Black and White, which they also usually
  call Colours, of each of which they have several kinds, such as <i>Bone
  Black</i>, made of <i>Ivory</i> burnt in a close Vessel, and <i>Blue
  Black</i>, made of the small coal of <i>Willow</i>, or some other Wood;
  and <i>Cullens earth</i>, which is a kind of brown Black, &amp;c. Their
  usual Whites are either artificial or natural <i>White Lead</i>, the last
  of which is the best they yet have, and with the mixing and tempering
  these colours together, are they able to make an imitation of any colour
  whatsoever: Their Reds or deep Yellows, they can <i>dilute</i> by mixing
  pale Yellows with them, and deepen their pale by mixing deeper with them;
  for it is not with <i>Opacous</i> colours as it is with transparent,
  where by adding more Yellow to yellow, it is deepned, but in
  <i>opacous</i> <i>diluted</i>. They can whiten any colour by mixing White
  with it, and darken any colour by mixing Black, or some dark and dirty
  colour. And in a word, most of the colours, or colour'd bodies they use
  in Limning and Painting, are such, as though mixt with any other of their
  colours, they preserve their own hue, and by being in such very smal
  parts dispers'd through the other colour'd bodies, they both, or
  altogether represent to the eye a <i>compositum</i> of all; the eye being
  unable, by reason of their smalness, to distinguish the peculiarly
  colour'd particles, but receives them as one intire <i>compositum</i>:
  whereas in many of these, the <i>Microscope</i> very easily distinguishes
  each of the compounding colours distinct, and exhibiting its own
  colour.</p>

  <p>Thus have I by gently mixing <i>Vermilion</i> and <i>Bise</i> dry,
  produc'd a very fine Purple, or mixt colour, but looking on it with the
  <i>Microscope</i>, I could easily distinguish both the Red and the Blue
  particles, which did not at all produce the <i>Phantasm</i> of
  Purple.</p>

  <p>To summ up all therefore in a word, I have not yet found any solid
  colour'd body, that I have yet examin'd, perfectly <i>opacous</i>; but
  those that are least transparent are <i>Metalline</i> and <i>Mineral</i>
  bodies, whose particles generally, seeming either to be very small, or
  very much flaw'd, appear for the most part <i>opacous</i>, though there
  are very few of them that I have look'd on with a <i>Microscope</i>, that
  have not very plainly or circumstantially manifested themselves
  transparent.</p>

  <p>And indeed, there seem to be so few bodies in the world that are <i>in
  minimis</i> opacous, that I think one may make it a rational
  <i>Query</i>, Whether there be any body absolutely thus <i>opacous</i>?
  For I doubt not at all (and I have taken notice of very many
  circumstances that make me of this mind) that could we very much improve
  the <i>Microscope</i>, we might be able to see all those bodies very
  plainly transparent, which we now are fain onely to ghess at by
  circumstances. Nay, the Object Glasses we yet make use of are such, that
  they make many transparent bodies to the eye, seem
  <i>opacous</i> through them, which if we widen the Aperture a little, and
  cast more light on the objects, and not charge the Glasses so deep, will
  again disclose their transparency.</p>

  <p>Now, as for all kinds of colours that are dissolvable in Water, or
  other liquors, there is nothing so manifest, as that all those ting'd
  liquors are transparent; and many of them are capable of being
  <i>diluted</i> and compounded or mixt with other colours, and divers of
  them are capable of being very much chang'd and heightned, and fixt with
  several kinds of <i>Saline menstruums</i>. Others of them upon
  compounding, destroy or vitiate each others colours, and
  <i>precipitate</i>, or otherwise very much alter each others tincture. In
  the true ordering and <i>diluting</i>, and deepning, and mixing, and
  fixing of each of which, consists one of the greatest mysteries of the
  Dyers; of which particulars, because our <i>Microscope</i> affords us
  very little information, I shall add nothing more at present; but onely
  that with a very few tinctures order'd and mixt after certain ways, too
  long to be here set down, I have been able to make an appearance of all
  the various colours imaginable, without at all using the help of
  <i>Salts</i>, or <i>Saline menstruums</i> to vary them.</p>

  <p>As for the mutation of Colours by <i>Saline menstruums</i>, they have
  already been so fully and excellently handled by the lately mention'd
  Incomparable <i>Authour</i>, that I can add nothing, but that of a
  multitude of trials that I made, I have found them exactly to agree with
  his Rules and Theories; and though there may be infinite instances, yet
  may they be reduc'd under a few Heads, and compris'd within a very few
  Rules. And generally I find, that <i>Saline menstruums</i> are most
  operative upon those colours that are Purple, or have some degree of
  Purple in them, and upon the other colours much less. The <i>spurious</i>
  pulses that compose which, being (as I formerly noted) so very neer the
  middle between the true ones, that a small variation throws them both to
  one side, or both to the other, and so consequently must make a vast
  mutation in the formerly appearing Colour.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXI" id="obsXI">XI</a>. <i>Of </i>Figures<i> observ'd in small Sand.</i></h3>

  <p>Sand generally seems to be nothing else but exceeding small Pebbles,
  or at least some very small parcels of a bigger stone; the whiter kind
  seems through the <i>Microscope</i> to consist of small transparent
  pieces of some <i>pellucid</i> body, each of them looking much like a
  piece of <i>Alum</i>, or <i>Salt Gem</i>; and this kind of Sand is angled
  for the most part irregularly, without any certain shape, and the
  <i>granules</i> of it are for the most part flaw'd, through amongst many
  of them it is not difficult to find some that are perfectly
  <i>pellucid</i>, like a piece of clear Crystal, and divers likewise most
  curiously shap'd, much after the manner of the bigger <i>Stiriæ</i> of
  Crystal, or like the small Diamants I observ'd in certain Flints, of
  which I shall by and by relate; which last particular seems to argue,
  that this kind of Sand is not made by the comminution of
  greater transparent Crystaline bodies, but by the <i>concretion</i> or
  <i>coagulation</i> of Water, or some other fluid body.</p>

  <p>There are other kinds of courser Sands, which are browner, and have
  their particles much bigger; these, view'd with a <i>Microscope</i>, seem
  much courser and more <i>opacous</i> substances, and most of them are of
  some irregularly rounded Figures; and though they seem not so
  <i>opacous</i> as to the naked eye, yet they seem very foul and cloudy,
  but neither do these want curiously transparent, no more than they do
  regularly figur'd and well colour'd particles, as I have often found.</p>

  <p>There are multitudes of other kinds of Sands, which in many
  particulars, plainly enough discoverable by the <i>Microscope</i>, differ
  both from these last mention'd kinds of Sands, and from one another:
  there seeming to be as great variety of Sands, as there is of Stones. And
  as amongst Stones some are call'd precious from their excellency, so also
  are there Sands which deserve the same Epithite for their beauty; for
  viewing a small parcel of <i>East-India</i> Sand (which was given me by
  my highly honoured friend, Mr. <i>Daniel Colwall</i>) and, since that,
  another parcel, much of the same kind, I found several of them, both very
  transparent like precious Stones, and regularly figur'd like Crystal,
  <i>Cornish</i> Diamants, some Rubies, <i>&amp;c.</i> and also ting'd with
  very lively and deep colours, like <i>Rubys</i>, <i>Saphyrs</i>,
  <i>Emeralds</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> These kinds of granuls I have often found
  also in <i>English</i> Sand. And 'tis easie to make such a counterfeit
  Sand with deeply ting'd Glass, Enamels and Painters colours.</p>

  <p>It were endless to describe the multitudes of Figures I have met with
  in these kind of minute bodies, such as <i>Spherical</i>, <i>Oval</i>,
  <i>Pyramidal</i>, <i>Conical</i>, <i>Prismatical</i>, of each of which
  kinds I have taken notice.</p>

  <p>But amongst many others, I met with none more observable than this
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-05.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 5.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> X.
</span>
  pretty Shell (described in the <i>Figure</i> X. of the fifth
  <i>Scheme</i>) which, though as it was light on by chance, deserv'd to
  have been omitted (I being unable to direct any one to find the like) yet
  for its rarity was it not inconsiderable, especially upon the account of
  the information it may afford us. For by it we have a very good instance
  of the curiosity of Nature in another kind of Animals which are remov'd,
  by reason of their minuteness, beyond the reach of our eyes, so that as
  there are several sorts of Insects, as Mites, and others, so small as not
  yet to have had any names; (some of which I shall afterwards describe)
  and small Fishes, as Leeches in Vineger; and smal vegetables, as Moss,
  and Rose-Leave-plants; and small Mushroms, as mould: so are there, it
  seems, small Shel-fish likewise, Nature shewing her curiosity in every
  Tribe of <i>Animals</i>, <i>Vegetables</i>, and <i>Minerals</i>.</p>

  <p>I was trying several small and single Magnifying Glasses, and casually
  viewing a parcel of white Sand, when I perceiv'd one of the grains
  exactly shap'd and wreath'd like a Shell, but endeavouring to distinguish
  it with my naked eye, it was so very small, that I was fain again to make
  use of the Glass to find it; then, whilest I thus look'd on it, with a
  Pin I separated all the rest of the granules of Sand, and found it
  afterwards to appear to the naked eye an exceeding small white spot, no
  bigger than the point of a Pin. Afterwards I view'd it
  every way with a better <i>Microscope</i> and found it on both sides, and
  edge-ways, to resemble the Shell of a small Water-Snail with a flat
  spiral Shell: it had twelve wreathings, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>,
  <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, &amp;c. all very proportionably growing one less than
  another toward the middle or center of the Shell, where there was a very
  small round white spot. I could not certainly discover whether the Shell
  were hollow or not, but it seem'd fill'd with somewhat, and 'tis probable
  that it might be <i>petrify'd</i> as other larger Shels often are, such
  as are mention'd in the seventeenth <i>Observation</i>.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXII" id="obsXII">XII</a>. <i>Of </i>Gravel<i> in Urine.</i></h3>

  <p>I Have often observ'd the Sand or Gravel of Urine, which seems to be a
  <i>tartareous</i> substance, generated out of a <i>saline</i> and a
  <i>terrestrial</i> substance <i>crystalliz'd</i> together, in the form of
  <i>Tartar</i>, sometimes sticking to the sides of the <i>Urinal</i>, but
  for the most part sinking to the bottom, and there lying in the form of
  coorse common Sand; these, through the <i>Microscope</i>, appear to be a
  company of small bodies, partly transparent and partly <i>opacous</i>,
  some White, some Yellow, some Red, others of more brown and duskie
  colours.</p>

  <p>The Figure of them is for the most part flat, in the manner of Slats
  or such like plated Stones, that is, each of them seem to be made up of
  several other thinner Plates, much like <i>Muscovie Glass</i>, or
  <i>Englsh Sparr</i> to the last of which, the white plated Gravel seems
  most likely; for they seem not onely plated like that, but their sides
  shap'd also into <i>Rhombs</i>, <i>Rhomboeids</i>, and sometimes into
  <i>Rectangles</i> and <i>Squares</i>. Their bigness and Figure may be
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-07.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 7.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 2.
</span>
  seen in the second <i>Figure</i> of the seventh <i>Plate</i>, which
  represents about a dozen of them lying upon a plate ABCD, some of which,
  as <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i> seem'd more regular than the
  rest, and <i>e</i>, which was a small one, sticking on the top of
  another, was a perfet <i>Rhomboeid</i> on the top, and had four
  <i>Rectangular</i> sides.</p>

  <p>The line E which was the the measure of the <i>Microscope</i>, is 1/32
  part of an <i>English</i> Inch, so that the greatest bredth of any of
  them, exceeded not 1/128 part of an Inch.</p>

  <p>Putting these into several liquors, I found <i>oyl of Vitriol</i>,
  <i>Spirit of Urine</i>, and several other <i>Saline menstruums</i> to
  dissolve them; and the first of these in less than a minute without
  <i>Ebullition</i>, Water, and several other liquors, had no sudden
  operation upon them. This I mention, because those liquors that dissolve
  them, first make them very white, not <i>vitiating</i>, but rather
  rectifying their Figure, and thereby make them afford a very pretty
  object for the <i>Microscope</i>.</p>

  <p>How great an advantage it would be to such as are troubled with the
  Stone, to find some <i>menstruum</i> might dissolve them without hurting
  the Bladder, is easily imagin'd, since some <i>injections</i> made of
  such bodies might likewise dissolve the stone, which seems much of the
  same nature.</p>

  <p>It may therefore, perhaps, be worthy some Physicians enquiry, whether
  there may not be something mixt with the Urine in which the Gravel or
  Stone lies, which may again make it dissolve it, the first of which seems
  by it's regular Figures to have been sometimes <i>Crystalliz'd</i> out of
  it. For whether this <i>Crystallization</i> be made in the manner as
  <i>Alum</i>, <i>Peter</i>, &amp;c. are <i>crystallized</i> out of a
  cooling liquor, in which, by boyling they have been dissolv'd; or whether
  it be made in the manner of <i>Tartarum Vitriolatum</i>, that is, by the
  <i>Coalition</i> of an <i>acid</i> and a <i>Sulphureous</i> substance, it
  seems not impossible, but that the liquor it lies in, may be again made a
  <i>dissolvent</i> of it. But leaving these inquiries to Physicians or
  Chymists, to whom it does more properly belong, I shall proceed.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXIII" id="obsXIII">XIII</a>. <i>Of the small </i>Diamants<i>, or </i>Sparks<i> in </i>Flints<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Chancing to break a Flint stone in pieces, I found within it a certain
  cavity all crusted over with a very pretty candied substance, some of the
  parts of which, upon changing the posture of the Stone, in respect of the
  <i>Incident</i> light, exhibited a number of small, but very vivid
  reflections; and having made use of my <i>Microscope</i>, I could
  perceive the whole surface of that cavity to be all beset with a
  multitude of little <i>Crystaline</i> or <i>Adamantine</i> bodies, so
  curiously shap'd, that it afforded a not unpleasing object.</p>

  <p>Having considered those vivid <i>repercussions</i> of light, I found
  them to be made partly from the plain external surface of these regularly
  figured bodies (which afforded the vivid reflexions) and partly to be
  made from within the somewhat <i>pellucid</i> body, that is, from some
  surface of the body, opposite to that superficies of it which was next
  the eye.</p>

  <p>And because these bodies were so small, that I could not well come to
  make Experiments and Examinations of them, I provided me several small
  <i>stiriæ</i> of Crystals or Diamants, found in great quantities in
  <i>Cornwall</i> and are therefore commonly called <i>Cornish
  Diamants</i>: these being very <i>pellucid</i>, and growing in a hollow
  cavity of a Rock (as I have been several times informed by those that
  have observ'd them) much after the same manner as these do in the Flint,
  and having besides their outward surface very regularly shap'd, retaining
  very near the same Figures with some of those I observ'd in the other,
  became a convenient help to me for the Examination of the proprieties of
  those kinds of bodies.</p>

  <p>And first for the Reflections, in these I found it very observable,
  That the brightest reflections of light proceeded from within the
  <i>pellucid</i> body; that is, that the Rays admitted through the
  <i>pellucid</i> substance in their getting out on the opposite side, were
  by the contiguous and strong reflecting surface of the Air very vividly
  reflected, so that more Rays were reflected to the eye by this surface,
  though the Ray in entring and getting out of the Crystal had suffer'd a
  double refraction, than there were from the outward surface of the Glass
  where the Ray had suffer'd no reflection at all.</p>

  <p>And that this was the surface of the Air that gave so vivid a
  <i>re-percussion</i> I try'd by this means I sunk half of a <i>stiria</i>
  in Water, so that only Water was contiguous to the under surface, and
  then the internal reflection was so exceedingly faint, that it was scarce
  discernable. Again, I try'd to alter this vivid reflection by keeping off
  the Air, with a body not fluid, and that was by rubbing and holding my
  finger very hard against the under surface, so as in many places the pulp
  of my finger did touch the Glass, without any <i>interjacent</i> air
  between, then observing the reflection, I found, that wheresoever my
  finger or skin toucht the surface, from that part there was no
  reflection, but in the little furrows or creases of my skin, where there
  remain'd little small lines of air, from them was return'd a very vivid
  reflection as before. I try'd further, by making the surface of very pure
  Quicksilver to be contiguous to the under surface of this <i>pellucid</i>
  body, and then the reflection from that was so exceedingly more vivid
  than from the air, as the reflection from air was than the reflection
  from the Water; from all which trials I plainly saw, that the strong
  reflecting air was the cause of this <i>Phænomenon</i>.</p>

  <p>And this agrees very well with the <i>Hypothesis</i> of light and
  <i>Pellucid</i> bodies which I have mention'd in the description of
  <i>Muscovy-glass</i>; for we there suppose Glass to be a <i>medium</i>,
  which does less resist the pulse of light, and consequently, that most of
  the Rays incident on it enter into it, and are refracted towards the
  <i>perpendicular</i>; whereas the air I suppose to be a body that does
  more resist it, and consequently more are <i>re-percuss'd</i> then do
  enter it: the same kind of trials have I made, with <i>Crystalline
  Glass</i>, with drops of fluid bodies, and several other ways, which do
  all seem to agree very exactly with this <i>Theory</i>. So that from this
  Principle well establish'd, we may deduce severall Corollaries not
  unworthy observation.</p>

  <p>And the first is; that it plainly appears by this, that the production
  of the Rainbow is as much to be ascribed to the reflection of the concave
  surface of the air, as to the refraction of the <i>Globular</i> drops:
  this will be evidently manifest by these Experiments, if you
  <i>foliate</i> that part of a Glass-ball that is to reflect an
  <i>Iris</i>, as in the <i>Cartesian</i> Experiment, above mention'd, the
  reflections will be abundantly more strong, and the colours more vivid:
  and if that part of the surface be touch'd with Water, scarce affords any
  sensible colour at all.</p>

  <p>Next we learn, that the great reason why <i>pellucid</i> bodies beaten
  small are white, is from the multitude of reflections, not from the
  particles of the body, but from the <i>contiguous</i> surface of the air.
  And this is evidently manifested, by filling the <i>Interstitia</i> of
  those powder'd bodies with Water, whereby their whiteness presently
  disappears. From the same reason proceeds the whiteness of many kinds of
  Sands, which in the <i>Microscope</i> appear to be made up of a multitude
  of little <i>pellucid</i> bodies, whose brightest reflections may by the
  <i>Microscope</i> be plainly perceiv'd to come from their internal
  surfaces; and much of the whiteness of it may be destroy'd by the
  affusion of fair Water to be contiguous to those surfaces.</p>

  <p>The whiteness also of froth, is for the most part to be ascribed to
  the reflection of the light from the surface of
  the air within the Bubbles, and very little to the reflection from the
  surface of the Water it self: for this last reflection does not return a
  quarter so many Rays, as that which is made from the surface of the air,
  as I have certainly found by a multitude of Observations and
  Experiments.</p>

  <p>The whiteness of <i>Linnen</i>, <i>Paper</i>, <i>Silk</i>, &amp;c.
  proceeds much from the same reason, as the <i>Microscope</i> will easily
  discover; for the Paper is made up of an abundance of <i>pellucid</i>
  bodies, which afford a very plentifull reflection from within, that is,
  from the concave surface of the air contiguous to its component
  particles; wherefore by the affusion of Water, Oyl, Tallow, Turpentine,
  <i>&amp;c.</i> all those reflections are made more faint, and the beams
  of light are suffer'd to traject &amp; run through the Paper more
  freely.</p>

  <p>Hence further we may learn the reason of the whiteness of many bodies,
  and by what means they maybe in part made <i>pellucid</i>: As white
  Marble for instance, for this body is composed of a <i>pellucid</i> body
  exceedingly flaw'd, that is, there are abundance of thin, and very fine
  cracks or chinks amongst the multitude of particles of the body, that
  contain in them small parcels of air, which do so <i>re-percuss</i> and
  drive back the penetrating beams, that they cannot enter very deep within
  that body; which the <i>Microscope</i> does plainly inform us to be made
  up of a <i>Congeries</i> of <i>pellucid</i> particles. And I further
  found it somewhat more evidently by some attempts I made towards the
  making transparent Marble, for by heating the Stone a little, and baking
  it in Oyl, Turpentine, Oyl of Turpentine, <i>&amp;c.</i>, I found that I
  was able to see much deeper into the body of Marble then before; and one
  trial, which was not with an unctuous substance, succeeded better than
  the rest, of which, when I have a better opportunity, I shall make
  further trial.</p>

  <p>This also gives us a probable reason of the so much admired
  <i>Phænomena</i>, of the <i>Oculus Mundi</i>, an <i>Oval</i> stone, which
  commonly looks like white Alabaster, but being laid a certain time in
  Water, it grows <i>pellucid</i>, and transparent, and being suffer'd to
  lie again dry, it by degrees loses that transparency, and becomes white
  as before. For the Stone being of a hollow spongie nature, has in the
  first and last of these appearances, all those pores fill'd with the
  obtunding and reflecting air; whereas in the second, all those pores are
  fill'd with a <i>medium</i> that has much the same refraction with the
  particles of the Stone, and therefore those two being <i>contiguous</i>,
  make, as 'twere, one <i>continued medium</i>, of which more is said in
  the 15. <i>Observation</i>.</p>

  <p>There are a multitude of other <i>Phænomena</i>, that are produc'd
  from this same Principle, which as it has not been taken notice of by any
  yet that I know, so I think, upon more diligent observation, will it not
  be found the least considerable. But I have here onely time to hint
  <i>Hypotheses</i>, and not to prosecute them so fully as I could wish;
  many of them having a vast extent in the production of a multitude of
  <i>Phænomena</i>, which have been by others, either not attempted to be
  explain'd, or else attributed to some other cause than what I have
  assign'd, and perhaps than the right; and therefore I shall leave this to
  the prosecution of such as have more leisure: onely before
  I leave it, I must not pretermit to hint, that by this Principle,
  multitudes of the <i>Phænomena</i> of the air, as about <i>Mists</i>,
  <i>Clouds</i>, <i>Meteors</i>, <i>Haloes</i>, &amp;c. are most plainly
  and (perhaps) truly explicable; multitudes also of the <i>Phænomena</i>
  in colour'd bodies, as liquors, <i>&amp;c.</i> are deducible from it.</p>

  <p>And from this I shall proceed to a second considerable
  <i>Phænomenon</i> which these Diamants exhibit, and that is the
  regularity of their <i>Figure</i>, which is a propriety not less general
  than the former, It comprising within its extent, all kinds of
  <i>Metals</i>, all kinds of <i>Minerals</i>, most <i>Precious stones</i>,
  all kinds of <i>Salts</i>, multitudes of <i>Earths</i>, and almost all
  kinds of <i>fluid bodies</i>. And this is another propiety, which, though
  a little superficially taken notice of by some, has not, that I know,
  been so much as attempted to be explicated by any.</p>

  <p>This propriety of bodies, as I think it the most worthy, and next in
  order to be consider'd after the contemplation of the <i>Globular
  Figure</i>, so have I long had a desire as wel as a determination to have
  prosecuted it if I had had an opportunity, having long since propos'd to
  my self the method of my enquiry therein, it containing all the
  allurements that I think any enquiry is capable of: For, first I take it
  to proceed from the most simple principle that any kind of form can come
  from, next the <i>Globular</i>, which was therefore the first I set upon,
  and what I have therein perform'd, I leave the Judicious Reader to
  determine. For as that form proceeded from a propiety of fluid bodies,
  which I have call'd <i>Congruity</i>, or <i>Incongruity</i>; so I think,
  had I time and opportunity, I could make probable, that all these regular
  Figures that are so conspicuously <i>various</i> and <i>curious</i>, and
  do so adorn and beautifie such multitudes of bodies, as I have above
  hinted, arise onely from three or four several positions or postures of
  <i>Globular</i> particles, and those the most plain, obvious, and
  necessary conjunctions of such figur'd particles that are possible, so
  that supposing such and such plain and obvious causes concurring the
  <i>coagulating particles</i> must necessarily compose a body of such a
  determinate regular Figure, and no other, and this with as much necessity
  and obviousness as a fluid body encompast with a <i>Heterogeneous</i>
  fluid must be protruded into a <i>Spherule</i> or <i>Globe</i>. And this
  I have <i>ad oculum</i> demonstrated with a company of bullets, and some
  few other very simple bodies; so that there was not any regular Figure,
  which I have hitherto met withall, of any of those bodies that I have
  above named, that I could not with the composition of bullets or
  globules, and one or two other bodies, imitate, even almost by shaking
  them together. And thus for instance may we find that the <i>Globular</i>
  bullets will of themselves, if put on an inclining plain, so that they
  may run together, naturally run into a <i>triangular</i> order, composing
  all the variety of figures that can be imagin'd to be made out of
  <i>æquilateral triangles</i>; and such will you find, upon trial, all the
  Surfaces of <i>Alum</i> to be compos'd of: For three bullets lying on a
  plain, as close to one another as they can compose an
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-07.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 7.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> A. <i>&amp;c.</i>
</span>
  <i>æquilatero-triangular</i> form, as in A in the 7. <i>Scheme</i>. If a
  fourth be joyn'd to them on either side as closely as it can, they four
  compose the most regular Rhombus consisting of two <i>æquilateral
  triangles</i>, as B. If a fifth be joyn'd to them on either
  side in as close a position as it can, which is the propriety of the
  <i>Texture</i>, it makes a <i>Trapezium</i>, or four-sided Figure, two of
  whole angles are 120. and two 60. degrees, as C. If a sixth be added, as
  before, either it makes an <i>æquilateral triangle</i>, as D, or a
  Rhomboeid, as E, or an <i>Hex-angular Figure</i>, as F, which is compos'd
  of two <i>primary Rhombes</i>. If a seventh be added, it makes either an
  <i>æquilatero-hexagonal</i> Figure, as G, or some kind of six-sided
  <i>Figure</i>, as H, or I. And though there be never so many placed
  together, they may be rang'd into some of these lately mentioned Figures,
  all the angles of which will be either <i>60</i>. degrees, or 120. as the
  figure K. which is an <i>æquiangular hexagonal</i> Figure is compounded
  of 12. <i>Globules</i>, or may be of 25, or 27, or 36, or 42,
  <i>&amp;c.</i> and by these kinds of texture, or position of globular
  bodies, may you find out all the variety of regular shapes, into which
  the smooth surfaces of <i>Alum</i> are form'd, as upon examination any
  one may easily find; nor does it hold only in superficies, but in
  solidity also, for it's obvious that a fourth <i>Globule</i> laid upon
  the third in this texture, composes a regular <i>Tetrahedron</i>, which
  is a very usual Figure of the <i>Crystals</i> of <i>Alum</i>. And (to
  hasten) there is no one Figure into which <i>Alum</i> is observ'd to be
  crystallized, but may by this texture of <i>Globules</i> be imitated, and
  by no other.</p>

  <p>I could instance also in the Figure of <i>Sea-salt</i>, and
  <i>Sal-gem</i>, that it is compos'd of a texture of <i>Globules</i>,
  placed in a <i>cubical</i> form, as L, and that all the Figures of those
  Salts may be imitated by this texture of <i>Globules</i> and by no other
  whatsoever. And that the forms of <i>Vitriol</i> and of
  <i>Salt-Peter</i>, as also of <i>Crystal</i>, <i>Hore-frost</i>, &amp;c.
  are compounded of these two textures, but modulated by certain
  proprieties: But I have not here time to insist upon, as I have not
  neither to shew by what means <i>Globules</i> come to be thus context,
  and what those <i>Globules</i> are, and many other particulars requisite
  to a full and intelligible explication of this propriety of bodies. Nor
  have I hitherto found indeed an opportunity of prosecuting the inquiry so
  farr as I design'd; nor do I know when I may, it requiring abundance of
  time, and a great deal of assistance to go through with what I design'd;
  the model of which was this:</p>

  <p>First, to get as exact and full a collection as I could, of all the
  differing kinds of Geometrical figur'd bodies, some three or four several
  bodies of each kind.</p>

  <p>Secondly, with them to get as exact a History as possibly I could
  learn of their places of Generation or finding, and to enquire after as
  many circumstances that tended to the Illustrating of this Enquiry, as
  possibly I could observe.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, to make as many trials as upon experience I could find
  requisite, in Dissolutions and Coagulations of several crystallizing
  Salts; for the needfull instruction and information in this Enquiry.</p>

  <p>Fourthly, to make several trials on divers other bodies, as Metals,
  Minerals, and Stones, by dissolving them in several <i>Menstruums</i>,
  and crystalizing them, to see what Figures would arise from those several
  <i>Compositums</i>.</p>

  <p>Fifthly, to make Compositions and Coagulations of several Salts
  together into the same mass, to observe of what Figure the product of
  them would be; and in all, to note as many circumstances as I should
  judge conducive to my Enquiry.</p>

  <p>Sixthly, to enquire the closeness or rarity of the texture of these
  bodies, by examining their gravity, and their refraction,
  <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>Seventhly, to enquire particularly what operations the fire has upon
  several kinds of Salts, what changes it causes in their Figures,
  Textures, or Energies.</p>

  <p>Eighthly, to examine their manner of dissolution, or acting upon those
  bodies dissoluble in them; The texture of those bodies before and after
  the process. And this for the History.</p>

  <p>Next for the Solution, To have examin'd by what, and how many means,
  such and such Figures, actions and effects could be produc'd
  possibly.</p>

  <p>And lastly, from all circumstances well weigh'd, I should have
  endeavoured to have shewn which of them was most likely, and (if the
  informations by these Enquiries would have born it) to have demonstrated
  which of them it must be, and was.</p>

  <p>But to proceed, As I believe it next to the Globular the most simple;
  so do I, in the second place, judge it not less pleasant; for that which
  makes an Enquiry pleasant, are, first a noble <i>Inventum</i> that
  promises to crown the successfull endeavour; and such must certainly the
  knowledge of the efficient and concurrent causes of all these curious
  Geometrical Figures be, which has made the Philosophers hitherto to
  conclude nature in these things to play the Geometrician, according to
  that saying of <i>Plato</i>, <span lang="el" title="Ho Theos geometrei"
  >&#x201B;&#x39F; &#x398;&#x3B5;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;
  &#x3B3;&#x3B5;&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3C4;&#x3C1;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;</span>.
  Or next, a great variety of matter in the Enquiry; and here we meet with
  nothing less than the <i>Mathematicks</i> of nature, having every day a
  new Figure to contemplate, or a variation of the same in another
  body,</p>

  <p>Which do afford us a third thing, which will yet more sweeten the
  Enquiry, and that is, a multitude of information; we are not so much to
  grope in the dark, as in most other Enquiries, where the <i>Inventum</i>
  is great; for having such a multitude of instances to compare, and such
  easie ways of generating, or compounding and of destroying the form, as
  in the <i>Solution</i> and <i>Crystallization</i> of Salts, we cannot but
  learn plentifull information to proceed by. And this will further appear
  from the universality of the Principle which Nature has made use of
  almost in all inanimate bodies. And therefore, as the contemplation of
  them all conduces to the knowledg of any one; so from a Scientifical
  knowledge of any one does follow the fame of all, and every one.</p>

  <p>And fourthly, for the usefulness of this knowledge, when acquir'd;
  certainly none can doubt, that considers that it caries us a step forward
  into the Labirinth of Nature, in the right way towards the end we propose
  our selves in all Philosophical Enquiries. So that knowing what is the
  form of Inanimate or Mineral bodies, we shall be the better able to
  proceed in our next Enquiry after the forms of Vegetative   bodies; and last of all, of Animate ones, that seeming to be the highest
  step of natural knowledge that the mind of man is capable of.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXIV" id="obsXIV">XIV</a>. <i>Of several kindes of frozen </i>Figures<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>I have very often in a Morning, when there has been a great
  <i>hoar-frost</i>, with an indifferently magnifying <i>Microscope</i>,
  observ'd the small <i>Stiriæ</i>, or Crystalline beard, which then
  usually covers the face of most bodies that lie open to the cold air, and
  found them to be generally <i>Hexangular prismatical</i> bodies, much
  like the long Crystals of <i>Salt-peter</i>, save onely that the ends of
  them were differing: for whereas those of <i>Nitre</i> are for the most
  part <i>pyramidal</i>, being terminated either in a point or edge; these
  of Frost were hollow, and the cavity in some seem'd pretty deep, and this
  cavity was the more plainly to be seen, because usually one or other of
  the six <i>parallelogram</i> sides was wanting, or at least much shorter
  then the rest.</p>

  <p>But this was onely the Figure of the <i>Bearded hoar-frost</i>; and as
  for the particles of other kinds of <i>hoar-frosts</i>, they seem'd for
  the most part irregular, or of no certain Figure. Nay, the parts of those
  curious branchings, or <i>vortices</i>, that usually in cold weather
  tarnish the surface of Glass, appear through the <i>Microscope</i> very
  rude and unshapen, as do most other kinds of frozen <i>Figures</i>, which
  to the naked eye seem exceeding neat and curious, such as the Figures of
  <i>Snow</i>, frozen <i>Urine</i>, <i>Hail</i>, several <i>Figures</i>
  frozen in common Water, <i>&amp;c.</i> Some Observations of each of which
  I shall hereunto annex, because if well consider'd and examin'd, they
  may, perhaps, prove very instructive for the finding out of what I have
  endeavoured in the preceding Observation to shew, to be (next the
  <i>Globular Figure</i> which is caus'd by <i>congruity</i>, as I hope I
  have made probable in the sixth <i>Observation</i>) the most simple and
  plain operation of Nature, of which, notwithstanding we are yet
  ignorant.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<h3><i>Several Observables in the </i>six-branched<i> Figures form'd on the
surface of Urine by freezing.</i></h3>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-08.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 8.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 1.
</span>
  <p>1 The
  Figures were all frozen almost even with the surface of the <i>Urine</i>
  in the Vessel; but the bigger stems were a little <i>prominent</i> above
  that surface, and the parts of those stems which were nearest the center
  (<i>a</i>) were biggest above the surface.</p>

  <p>2 I have observ'd several kinds of these Figures, some smaller, no
  bigger then a Two-pence, others so bigg, that I have by measure found one
  of its stems or branches above four foot long; and of these, some were
  pretty round, having all their branches pretty neer alike; other of them
  were more extended towards one side, as usually those very large ones
  were, which I have observ'd in Ditches which
  have been full of foul water.</p>

  <p>3 None of all these Figures I have yet taken notice of, had any
  regular position in respect of one another, or of the sides of the
  Vessel; nor did I find any of them equally to exactness extended every
  way from the center <i>a</i>.</p>

  <p>4 Where ever there was a center, the branchings from it, <i>ab</i>,
  <i>ac</i>, <i>ad</i>, <i>ae</i>, <i>af</i>, <i>ag</i>, were never fewer,
  or more then six, which usually concurr'd, or met one another very neer
  in the same point or center, <i>a</i>; though oftentimes not exactly; and
  were enclin'd to each other by an angle, of very near sixty degrees, I
  say, very neer, because, though having endeavoured to measure them the
  most acurately I was able, with the largest Compasses I had, I could not
  find any sensible variation from that measure, yet the whole six-branched
  Figure seeming to compose a solid angle, they must necessarily be
  somewhat less.</p>

  <p>5 The middle lines or stems of these branches, <i>ab</i>, <i>ac</i>,
  <i>ad</i>, <i>ae</i>, <i>af</i>, <i>ag,</i> seem'd somewhat whiter, and a
  little higher then any of the <i>intermediate</i> branchings of these
  Figures; and the center <i>a</i>, was the most <i>prominent</i> part of
  the whole Figure, seeming the <i>apex</i> of a solid angle or
  <i>pyramid</i>, each of the six plains being a little enclin'd below the
  surface of the <i>Urin</i>.</p>

  <p>6 The lateral branchings issuing out of the great ones, such as
  <i>op</i>, <i>mq</i>, &amp;c. were each of them inclin'd to the great
  ones, by the same angle of about sixty degrees, as the great ones were
  one to another, and always the bigger branchings were <i>prominent</i>
  above the less, and the less above the least, by proportionate
  <i>gradations</i>.</p>

  <p>7 The <i>lateral</i> branches shooting out of the great ones, went all
  of them from the center, and each of them was parallel to that great
  branch, next to which it lay; so that as all the branches on one side
  were parallel to one another, so were they all of them to the
  <i>approximate</i> great branch, as <i>po</i>, <i>qr</i>, as they were
  parallel to each other, and shot from the center, so were they parallel
  also to the great branch <i>ab</i>.</p>

  <p>8 Some of the stems of the six branches proceeded straight, and of a
  thickness that gradually grew sharper towards the end, as <i>ag</i>.</p>

  <p>9 Others of the stems of those branches grew bigger and knotty towards
  the middle, and the branches also as well as stems, from Cylinders grew
  into Plates, in a most admirable and curious order, so exceeding regular
  and delicate, as nothing could be more, as is visible in <i>ab</i>,
  <i>ac</i>, <i>ad</i>, <i>ae</i>, <i>af</i>, but towards the end of some
  of these stems, they began again to grow smaller and to recover their
  former branchings, as about <i>k</i> and <i>n</i>.</p>

  <p>10 Many of the <i>lateral</i> branches had <i>collateral</i> branches
  (if I may so call them) as <i>qm</i> had many such as <i>st</i>, and most
  of those again <i>subcollateral</i>, as <i>vw</i>, and these again had
  others less, which one may call <i>laterosubcollateral</i>, and these
  again others, and they others, <i>&amp;c.</i> in greater Figures.</p>

  <p>11 The branchings of the main Stems joyn'd not together by any regular
  line, nor did one side of the one lie over the other side of the other,
  but the small <i>collateral</i> and <i>subcollateral</i> branches did lie
  at top of one another according to a certain order or
  method, which I always observ'd to be this.</p>

  <p>12 That side of a <i>collateral</i> or <i>subcollateral</i>, &amp;c.
  branch, lay over the side of the <i>approximate</i> (as the feathers in
  the wing of a Bird) whose branchings proceeded parallel to the last
  biggest stem from which it sprung, and not to the biggest stem of all,
  unless that were a second stem backwards.</p>

  <p>13 This rule that held in the branchings of the <i>Sexangular
  Figure</i> held also in the branchings of any other great or small stem,
  though it did not proceed from a center.</p>

  <p>14 The exactness and curiosity of the figuration of these branches,
  was in every particular so transcendent, that I judge it almost
  impossible for humane art to imitate.</p>

  <p>15 Tasting several cleer pieces of this <i>Ice</i>, I could not find
  any <i>Urinous</i> taste in them, but those few I tasted, seem'd as
  <i>insipid</i> as water.</p>

  <p>16 A figuration somewhat like this, though indeed in some particulars
  much more curious, I have several times observ'd in <i>regulus martis
  stellatus</i>, but with this difference, that all the stems and
  branchings are bended in a most excellent and regular order, whereas in
  <i>Ice</i> the stems and branchings are streight, but in all other
  particulars it agrees with this, and seems indeed nothing but one of
  these stars, or branched Figures frozen on <i>Urine</i>, distorted, or
  wreathed a little, with a certain proportion: <i>Lead</i> also that has
  <i>Arsenick</i> and some other things mixt with it, I have found to have
  its surface, when suffer'd to cool, figured somewhat like the branchings
  of <i>Urine</i>, but much smaller.</p>

  <p>17 But there is a <i>Vegetable</i> which does exceedingly imitate
  these branches, and that is, <i>Fearn</i>, where the main stem may be
  observ'd to shoot out branches, and the stems of each of these
  <i>lateral</i> branches, to send forth <i>collateral</i>, and those
  <i>subcollateral</i> and those <i>laterosubcollateral,</i> &amp;c. and
  all those much after the same order with the branchings, divisions, and
  subdivisions in the branchings of these Figures in frozen <i>Urine</i>;
  so that if the Figures of both be well consider'd, one would ghess that
  there were not much greater need of a <i>seminal principle</i> for the
  production of <i>Fearn</i>, then for the production of the branches of
  <i>Urine</i>, or the <i>Stella martis</i>, there seeming to be as much
  form and beauty in the one as in the other.</p>

  <p>And indeed, this Plant of <i>Fearn</i>, if all particulars be well
  consider'd, will seem of as simple, and uncompounded a form as any
  <i>Vegetable</i>, next to <i>Mould</i> or <i>Mushromes</i>, and would
  next after the invention of the forms of those, deserve to be enquir'd
  into; for notwithstanding several have affirm'd it to have seed, and to
  be propagated thereby; yet, though I have made very diligent enquiry
  after that particular, I cannot find that there is any part of it that
  can be imagin'd to be more seminal then another: But this onely here by
  the by:</p>

  <p>For the freezing Figures in <i>Urine</i>, I found it requisite,</p>

  <p>First, that the Superficies be not disturbed with any wind, or other
  commotion of the air, or the like.</p>

  <p>Secondly, that it be not too long exposed, so as that the whole bulk
  be frozen, for oftentimes, in such cases, by reason of the swelling the
  of <i>Ice</i>, or from some other cause, the curious branched Figures
  disappear.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, an artificial freezing with <i>Snow</i> and <i>Salt</i>,
  apply'd to the outside of the containing Vessel, succeeds not well,
  unless there be a very little quantity in the Vessel.</p>

  <p>Fourthly, If you take any cleer and smooth Glass, and wetting all the
  inside of it with <i>Urine</i>, you expose it to a very sharp freezing,
  you will find it cover'd with a very regular and curious Figure.</p>

<h3><i>Observables in figur'd </i>Snow<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Exposing a piece of black Cloth, or a black Hatt to the falling
  <i>Snow</i>, I have often with great pleasure, observ'd such an infinite
  variety of curiously figur'd <i>Snow</i>, that it would be as impossible
  to draw the Figure and shape of every one of them, as to imitate exactly
  the curious and Geometrical <i>Mechanisme</i> of Nature in any one. Some
  coorse draughts, such as the coldness of the weather, and the ill
  provisions, I had by me for such a purpose, would permit me to make, I

<a href="images/scheme-08.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 8.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 2.
</span>
  have here added in the Second <i>Figure</i> of the Eighth
  <i>Scheme</i>.</p>

  <p>In all which I observ'd, that if they were of any regular Figures,
  they were always branched out with six principal branches, all of equal
  length, shape and make, from the center, being each of them inclin'd to
  either of the next branches on either side of it, by an angle of sixty
  degrees.</p>

  <p>Now, as all these stems were for the most part in one flake exactly of
  the same make, so were they in differing Figures of very differing ones;
  so that in a very little time I have observ'd above an hundred several
  cizes and shapes of these starry flakes.</p>

  <p>The branches also out of each stem of any one of these flakes, were
  exactly alike in the same flake; so that of whatever Figure one of the
  branches were, the other five were sure to be of the same, very exactly,
  that is, if the branchings of the one were small <i>Perallelipipeds</i>
  or Plates, the branchings of the other five were of the same; and
  generally, the branchings were very conformable to the rules and method
  observ'd before, in the Figures on <i>Urine</i>, that is, the branchings
  from each side of the stems were parallel to the next stem on that side,
  and if the stems were plated, the branches also were the same; if the
  stems were very long, the branches also were so, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>Observing some of these figur'd flakes with a <i>Microscope</i>, I
  found them not to appear so curious and exactly figur'd as one would have
  imagin'd, but like Artificial Figures, the bigger they were magnify'd,
  the more irregularites appear'd in them; but this irregularity seem'd
  ascribable to the thawing and breaking of the flake by the fall, and not
  at all to the defect of the <i>plastick</i> virtue of Nature, whose
  curiosity in the formation of most of these kind of regular Figures, such
  as those of <i>Salt</i>, <i>Minerals</i>, &amp;c. appears by
  the help of the <i>Microscope</i>, to be very many degrees smaller then
  the most acute eye is able to perceive without it. And though one of
  these six-branched Stars appear'd here below much of the shape described
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-08.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 8.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 3.
</span>
  in the Third <i>Figure</i> of the Eighth <i>Scheme</i>; yet I am very apt
  to think, that could we have a sight of one of them through a
  <i>Microscope</i> as they are generated in the Clouds before their
  Figures are vitiated by external accidents, they would exhibit abundance
  of curiosity and neatness there also, though never so much magnify'd: For
  since I have observ'd the Figures of <i>Salts</i> and <i>Minerals</i> to
  be some of them so exceeding small, that I have scarcely been able to
  perceive them with the <i>Microscope</i>, and yet have they been regular,
  and since (as far as I have yet examin'd it) there seems to be but one
  and the same cause that produces both these effects, I think it not
  irrational to suppose that these pretty figur'd Stars of <i>Snow</i>,
  when at first generated might be also very regular and exact.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<h3><i>Several kinds of Figures in </i>Water<i> frozen.</i></h3>

  <p>Putting fair Water into a large capacious Vessel of <i>Glass</i>, and
  exposing it to the cold, I observ'd after a little time, several broad,
  flat, and thin <i>laminæ</i>, or plates of <i>Ice</i>, crossing the bulk
  of the water and one another very irregularly, onely most of them seem'd
  to turn one of their edges towards that side of the Glass which was next
  it, and seem'd to grow, as 'twere from the inside of the Vessel inwards
  towards the middle, almost like so many blades of <i>Fern</i>. Having
  taken several of these plates out of water on the blade of a Knife, I
  observ'd them figur'd much after the manner of <i>Herring bones</i>, or
  <i>Fern blades</i>, that is, there was one bigger stem in the middle like
  the back-bone, and out of it, on either side, were a multitude of small
  <i>stiriæ</i>, or <i>icicles</i>, like the smaller bones, or the smaller
  branches in <i>Fern</i>, each of these branches on the one side, were
  parallel to all the rest on the same side, and all of them seem'd to make
  an angle with the stem, towards the top, of sixty degrees, and towards
  the bottom or root of this stem, of 120. See the fourth <i>Figure</i> of
  the 8. <i>Plate</i>.</p>

  <p>I observ'd likewise several very pretty Varieties of Figures in Water,
  frozen on the top of a broad flat Marble-stone, expos'd to the cold with
  a little Water on it, some like feathers, some of other shapes, many of
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-08.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 8.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 5.
</span>
  them were very much of the shape exprest in the fifth Figure of the 8.
  <i>Scheme</i>, which is extremely differing from any of the other
  Figures.</p>

  <p>I observ'd likewise, that the shootings of <i>Ice</i> on the top of
  Water, beginning to freez, were in streight <i>prismatical</i> bodies
  much like those of <i>roch-peter</i>, that they crost each other usually
  without any kind of order or rule, that they were always a little higher
  then the surface of the Water that lay between them; that by degrees
  those <i>interjacent</i> spaces would be fill'd with <i>Ice</i> also,
  which usually would be as high as the surface of the rest.</p>

  <p>In flakes of <i>Ice</i> that had been frozen on the top of Water to
  any considerable thickness, I observ'd that both the upper and
  the under sides of it were curiously quill'd, furrow'd, or grain'd, as it
  were, which when the Sun shone on the Plate, was exceeding easily to be
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-08.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 8.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 6.
</span>
  perceiv'd to be much after the shape of the lines in the 6. <i>Figure</i>
  of the 8. <i>Scheme</i>, that is, they consisted of several streight ends
  of parallel Plates, which were of divers lengths and angles to one
  another without any certain order.</p>

  <p>The cause of all which regular Figures (and of hundreds of others,
  namely of <i>Salts</i>, <i>Minerals</i>, <i>Metals,</i> &amp;c. which I
  could have here inserted, would it not have been too long) seems to be
  deducible from the same Principles, which I have (in the 13.
  <i>Observation</i>) hinted only, having not yet had time to compleat a
  <i>Theory</i> of them. But indeed (which I there also hinted) I judge it
  the second step by which the <i>Pyramid</i> of natural knowledge (which
  is the knowledge of the form of bodies) is to be ascended: And whosoever
  will climb it, must be well furnish'd with that which the Noble
  <i>Verulam</i> calls <i>Scalam Intellectus</i>; he must have scaling
  Ladders, otherwise the steps are so large and high, there will be no
  getting up them, and consequently little hopes of attaining any higher
  station, such as to the knowledge of the most simple principle of
  Vegetation manifested in Mould and Mushromes, which, as I elsewhere
  endeavoured to shew, seems to be the third step; for it seems to me, that
  the Intellect of man is like his body, destitute of wings, and cannot
  move from a lower to a higher and more sublime station of knowledg,
  otherwise then step by step, nay even there where the way is prepar'd and
  already made passible; as in the <i>Elements of Geometry</i>, or the
  like, where it is fain to climb a whole <i>series</i> of Propositions by
  degrees, before it attains the knowledge of one <i>Probleme</i>. But if
  the ascent be high, difficult and above its reach, it must have recourse
  to a <i>novum organum</i>, some new engine and contrivance, some new kind
  of <i>Algebra</i>, or <i>Analytick Art</i> before it can surmount it.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXV" id="obsXV">XV</a>. <i>Of </i>Kettering-stone<i>, and of the pores of </i>Inanimate<i>
bodies.</i></h3>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-09.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 9.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 1.
</span>
  <p>This Stone which is brought from <i>Kettering</i> in <i>Northampton-Shire</i>,
  and digg'd out of a Quarry, as I am inform'd, has a grain altogether
  admirable, nor have I ever seen or heard of any other stone that has the
  like. It is made up of an innumerable company of small bodies, not all of
  the same cize or shape, but for the most part, not much differing from a
  Globular form, nor exceed they one another in Diameter above three or
  four times; they appear to the eye, like the Cobb or Ovary of a
  <i>Herring</i>, or some smaller fishes, but for the most part, the
  particles seem somewhat less, and not so uniform; but their variation
  from a perfect globular ball, seems to be only by the pressure of the
  <i>contiguous</i> bals which have a little deprest and protruded those
  toucht sides inward, and forc'd the other sides as much
  outwards beyond the limits of a Globe; just as it would happen, if a heap
  of exactly round Balls of soft Clay were heaped upon one another; or, as
  I have often seen a heap of small Globules of <i>Quicksilver</i>, reduc'd
  to that form by rubbing it much in a glaz'd Vessel, with some slimy or
  sluggish liquor, such as Spittle, when though the top of the upper
  Globules be very neer spherical, yet those that are prest upon by others,
  exactly imitate the forms of these lately mention'd grains.</p>

  <p>Where these grains touch each other, they are so firmly united or
  settled together, that they seldom part without breaking a hole in one or
  th'other of them, such as <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>,
  <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, &amp;c. Some of which fractions, as <i>a</i>,
  <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, where the touch has been but light, break
  no more then the outward crust, or first shell of the stone, which is of
  a white colour, a little dash'd with a brownish Yellow, and is very thin,
  like the shell of an Egg: and I have seen some of those grains perfectly
  resemble some kind of Eggs, both in colour and shape: But where the union
  of the <i>contiguous granules</i> has been more firm, there the divulsion
  has made a greater Chasm, as at <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, in so much
  that I have observ'd some of them quite broken in two, as at <i>c</i>,
  <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, which has discovered to me a further resemblance they
  have to Eggs, they having an appearance of a white and yelk, by two
  differing substances that envelope and encompass each other.</p>

  <p>That which we may call the white was pretty whitish neer the yelk, but
  more duskie towards the shell; some of them I could plainly perceive to
  be shot or radiated like a <i>Pyrites</i> or <i>fire-stone</i>; the yelk
  in some I saw hollow, in others fill'd with a duskie brown and porous
  substance like a kind of pith.</p>

  <p>The small pores, or <i>interstitia</i> <i>eeee</i> betwixt the
  Globules, I plainly saw, and found by other trials to be every way
  pervious to air and water, for I could blow through a piece of this stone
  of a considerable thickness, as easily as I have blown through a Cane,
  which minded me of the pores which <i>Des Cartes</i> allow his <i>materia
  subtilis</i> between the <i>æthereal</i> globules.</p>

  <p>The object, through the <i>Microscope</i>, appears like a
  <i>Congeries</i> or heap of Pibbles, such as I have often seen cast up on
  the shore, by the working of the Sea after a great storm, or like (in
  shape, though not colour) a company of small Globules of Quicksilver,
  look'd on with a <i>Microscope</i>, when reduc'd into that form by the
  way lately mentioned. And perhaps, this last may give some hint at the
  manner of the formation of the former: For supposing some
  <i>Lapidescent</i> substance to be generated, or some way brought (either
  by some commixture of bodies in the Sea it self, or protruded in,
  perhaps, out of some <i>subterraneous</i> caverns) to the bottom of the
  Sea, and there remaining in the form of a liquor like Quicksilver,
  <i>heterogeneous</i> to the ambient <i>Saline</i> fluid, it may by the
  working and tumblings of the Sea to and fro be jumbled and comminuted
  into such Globules as may afterwards be hardned into Flints, the lying of
  which one upon another, when in the Sea, being not very hard, by reason
  of the weight of the incompassing fluid, may cause the undermost to be a
  little, though not much, varied from a globular Figure. But this only by
  the by.</p>

  <p>After what manner this <i>Kettering-stone</i> should be generated I
  cannot learn, having never been there to view the place, and observe the
  circumstances; but it seems to me from the structure of it to be
  generated from some substance once more fluid, and afterwards by degrees
  growing harder, almost after the same manner as I supposed the generation
  of Flints to be made.</p>

  <p>But whatever were the cause of its curious texture, we may learn this
  information from it; that even in those things which we account vile,
  rude, and coorse, Nature has not been wanting to shew abundance of
  curiosity and excellent Mechanisme.</p>

  <p>We may here find a Stone by help of a <i>Microscope</i>, to be made up
  of abundance of small Balls, which do but just touch each other, and yet
  there being so many contacts, they make a firm hard mass, or a Stone much
  harder then Free-stone.</p>

  <p>Next, though we can by a <i>Microscope</i> discern so curious a shape
  in the particles, yet to the naked eye there scarce appears any such
  thing; which may afford us a good argument to think, that even in those
  bodies also, whose <i>texture</i> we are not able to discern, though
  help'd with <i>Microscopes</i>, there may be yet <i>latent</i> so curious
  a <i>Schematisme</i>, that it may abundantly satisfie the curious
  searcher, who shall be so happy as to find some way to discover it.</p>

  <p>Next, we here find a Stone, though to the naked eye a very close one,
  yet every way perforated with innumerable pores, which are nothing else
  but the <i>interstitia</i>, between those multitudes of minute globular
  particles, that compose the bulk it self, and these pores are not only
  discover'd by the <i>Microscope</i>, but by this contrivance.</p>

  <p>I took a pretty large piece of this stone, and covering it all over
  with cement, save only at two opposite parts, I found my self able, by
  blowing in at one end that was left open, to blow my spittle, with which
  I had wet the other end, into abundance of bubbles, which argued these
  pores to be open and pervious through the whole stone, which affords us a
  very pretty instance of the porousness of some seemingly close bodies, of
  which kind I shall anon have occasion to subjoyn many more, tending to
  prove the same thing.</p>

  <p>I must not here omit to take notice, that in this body there is not a
  <i>vegetative</i> faculty that should so contrive this structure for any
  peculiar use of <i>vegetation</i> or growth, whereas in the other
  instances of vegetable porous bodies, there is an <i>anima</i> or
  <i>forma informans</i>, that does contrive all the Structures and
  <i>Mechanismes</i> of the constituting body, to make them subservient and
  usefull to the great Work or Function they are to perform. And so I ghess
  the pores in Wood, and other vegetables, in bones, and other Animal
  substances, to be as so many channels, provided by the Great and Alwise
  Creator, for the conveyance of appropriated juyces to particular parts.
  And therefore, that this may tend, or be pervious all towards one part,
  and may have impediments, as valves or the like, to any other; but in
  this body we have very little reason so suspect there should be any such
  design, for it is equally pervious every way, not onely forward,
  but backwards, and side-ways, and seems
  indeed much rather to be <i>Homogeneous</i> or similar to those pores,
  which we may with great probability believe to be the channels of
  <i>pellucid</i> bodies, not directed, or more open any one way, then any
  other, being equally pervious every way. And, according as these pores
  are more or greater in respect of the <i>interstitial</i> bodies, the
  more transparent are the so constituted concretes; and the smaller those
  pores are, the weaker is the <i>Impulse</i> of light communicated through
  them, though the more quick be the progress.</p>

  <p>Upon this Occasion, I hope it will not be altogether unseasonable, if
  I propound my conjectures and <i>Hypothesis</i> about the <i>medium</i>
  and conveyance of light.</p>

  <p>I suppose then, that the greatest part of the <i>Interstitia</i> of
  the world, that lies between the bodies of the Sun and Starrs, and the
  Planets, and the Earth, to be an exceeding fluid body, very apt and ready
  to be mov'd, and to communicate the motion of any one part to any other
  part, though never so far distant: Nor do I much concern my self, to
  determine what the Figure of the particles of this exceedingly subtile
  fluid <i>medium</i> must be, nor whether it have any interstitiated pores
  or vacuities, it being sufficient to solve all the <i>Phænomena</i> to
  suppose it an exceedingly fluid, or the most fluid body in the world, and
  as yet impossible to determine the other difficulties.</p>

  <p>That being so exceeding fluid a body, it easily gives passage to all
  other bodies to move to and fro in it.</p>

  <p>That it neither receives from any of its parts, or from other bodies;
  nor communicates to any of its parts, or to any other body, any impulse,
  or motion in a direct line, that is not of a determinate quickness. And
  that when the motion is of such determinate swiftness, it both receives,
  and communicates, or propagates an impulse or motion to any imaginable
  distance in streight lines, with an unimaginable celerity and vigour.</p>

  <p>That all kind of solid bodies consist of pretty massie particles in
  respect of the particles of this fluid <i>medium</i>, which in many
  places do so touch each other, that none of this fluid <i>medium</i>
  interposes much after the same mannner (to use a gross similitude) as a
  heap of great stones compose one great <i>congeries</i> or mass in the
  midst of the water.</p>

  <p>That all fluid bodies which we may call <i>tangible</i>, are nothing
  but some more subtile parts of those particles, that serve to constitute
  all <i>tangible</i> bodies.</p>

  <p>That the water, and such other fluid bodies, are nothing but a
  <i>congeries</i> of particles agitated or made fluid by it in the same
  manner as the particles of <i>Salt</i> are agitated or made fluid by a
  parcel of water, in which they are dissolv'd, and subsiding to the bottom
  of it, constitute a fluid body, much more massie and dense, and less
  fluid then the pure water it self.</p>

  <p>That the air on the other side is a certain company of particles of
  quite another kind, that is, such as are very much smaller, and more
  easiely moveable by the motion of this fluid <i>medium</i>; much like
  those very subtile parts of <i>Cochenel</i>, other very deep tinging
  bodies, where by a very small parcel of matter is able
  to tinge and diffuse it self over a very great quantity of the fluid
  dissolvent; or somewhat after that manner, as smoak, and such like minute
  bodies, or steams, are observ'd to tinge a very great quantity of air;
  onely this last similitude is deficient in one propriety, and that is a
  perpetuity or continuance in that state of commixture with the air, but
  the former does more neerly approach to the nature and manner of the
  air's being dissolv'd by this fluid or <i>Æther</i>. And this Similitude
  will further hold in these proprieties; that as those tinctures may be
  increased by certain bodies, so may they be precipitated by others, as I
  shall afterwards shew it to be very probable, that the like accidents
  happen even to the Air it self.</p>

  <p>Further, as these solutions and tinctures do alter the nature of these
  fluid bodies, as to their aptness to propagate a motion or impulse
  through them, even so does the particles of the Air, Water, and other
  fluid bodies, and of Glass, Crystal, <i>&amp;c.</i> which are commixt
  with this bulk of the <i>Æther</i> alter the motion of the propagated
  pulse of light; that is, where these more bulkie particles are more
  plentifull, and consequently a lesser quantity of the <i>Æther</i>
  between them to be mov'd, there the motion must necessarily be the
  swifter, though not so robust, which will produce those effects, which I
  have (I hope) with some probability, ascribed to it in the digression
  about Colours, at the end of the <i>Observations</i> on
  <i>Muscovy-glass.</i></p>

  <p>Now, that other Stones, and those which have the closest and hardest
  textures, and seem (as far as we are able to discover with our eyes,
  though help'd with the best <i>Microscopes</i>) freest from pores, are
  yet notwithstanding replenish'd with them, an Instance or two will, I
  suppose, make more probable.</p>

  <p>A very solid and unflaw'd piece of cleer white <i>Marble</i>, if it be
  well polish'd and glaz'd, has so curiously smooth a surface, that the
  best and most polish'd surface of any wrought-glass, seems not to the
  naked eye, nor through a <i>Microscope</i>, to be more smooth, and less
  porous. And yet, that this hard close body is replenish'd with abundance
  of pores, I think these following Experiments will sufficiently
  prove.</p>

  <p>The first is, That if you take such a piece, and for a pretty while
  boyl it in Turpentine and Oyl of Turpentine, you shall find that the
  stone will be all imbu'd with it; and whereas before it look'd more
  white, but more opacous, now it will look more greasie, but be much more
  transparent, and if you let it lie but a little while, and then break off
  a part of it, you shall find the unctuous body to have penetrated it to
  such a determinate depth every way within the surface. This may be yet
  easier try'd with a piece of the same <i>Marble</i>, a little warm'd in
  the fire, and then a little Pitch or Tarr melted on the top of it; for
  these black bodies, by their insinuating themselves into the invisible
  pores of the stone, ting it with so black a hue, that there can be no
  further doubt of the truth of this assertion, that it abounds with small
  imperceptible pores.</p>

  <p>Now, that other bodies will also sink into the pores of <i>Marble</i>,
  besides unctuous, I have try'd, and found, that a very Blue tincture made
  in <i>spirit of Urine</i> would very readily and
  easily sink into it, as would also several tinctures drawn with <i>spirit
  of Wine</i>.</p>

  <p>Nor is <i>Marble</i> the only seemingly close stone, which by other
  kinds of Experiments may be found porous; for I have by this kind of
  Experiment on divers other stones found much the same effect, and in
  some, indeed much more notable. Other stones I have found so porous, that
  with the <i>Microscope</i> I could perceive several small winding holes,
  much like Worm-holes, as I have noted in some kind of
  <i>Purbeck-stone</i>, by looking on the surface of a piece newly flaw'd
  off, for if otherwise, the surface has been long expos'd to the Air, or
  has been scraped with any tool, those small caverns are fill'd with dust,
  and disappear.</p>

  <p>And to confirm this <i>Conjecture</i>, yet further, I shall here
  insert an excellent account, given into the <i>Royal Society</i> by that
  Eminently Learned Physician, Doctor <i>Goddard</i>, of an Experiment, not
  less instructive then curious and accurate, made by himself on a very
  hard and seemingly close stone call'd <i>Oculus Mundi</i>, as I find it
  preserv'd in the Records of that Honourable Society.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A small stone of the kind, call'd by some Authours, <i>Oculus
  Mundi</i>, being dry and cloudy, weigh'd 5-209/256 <i>Grains</i>.</p>

  <p>The same put under water for a night, and somewhat more, became
  transparent, and the superficies being wiped dry, weighed 6-3/256
  <i>Grains</i>.</p>

  <p>The difference between these two weights, 0-50/256 of a
  <i>Grain</i>.</p>

  <p>The same Stone kept out of water one Day and becoming cloudy again
  weighed, 5-225/256 <i>Graines</i>.</p>

  <p>Which was more then the first weight, 0-16/256 of a <i>Grain</i>.</p>

  <p>The same being kept two Days longer weighed, 5-202/256
  <i>Graines</i>.</p>

  <p>Which was less then at first, 0-7/256 a <i>Grain</i>.</p>

  <p>Being kept dry something longer it did not grow sensibly lighter.</p>

  <p>Being put under water for a night and becoming again transparent and
  wiped dry, the weight was, <i>6-3/256 Grains</i>, the same with the first
  after putting in water, and more then the last weight after keeping of it
  dry, 0-57/256 of a <i>Grain</i>.</p>

  <p>Another Stone of the same kind being variegated with milky
  <i>white</i> and <i>gray</i> like some sorts of <i>Agates</i>, while it
  lay under water, was alwaies invironed with little Bubbles, such as
  appear in water a little before boyling, next the sides
  of the Vessel.</p>

  <p>There were also some the like Bubbles on the Surface of the water just
  over it, as if either some exhalations came out of it, or that it did
  excite some fermentation in the parts of the water contiguous to it.</p>

  <p>There was little sensible difference in the transparency of this
  Stone, before the putting under water, and after: To be sure the
  milky-<i>white</i> parts continued as before, but more difference in
  weight then in the former. For whereas before the putting into the water
  the weight was 18-97/128 <i>Graines</i>. After it had lyen in about four
  and twenty hours the weight was 20-27/128 <i>Graines</i>, so the
  difference was, 1-58/128 <i>Graines</i>.</p>

  <p>The same Stone was infused in the water scalding hot, and so continued
  for a while after it was cold, but got no more weight then upon infusing
  in the cold, neither was there any sensible Difference in the weight both
  times.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In which Experiment, there are three Observables that seem very
  manifestly to prove the porousness of these seemingly close bodies: the
  first is their acquiring a transparency, and losing their whiteness after
  steeping in water, which will seem the more strongly to argue it, if what
  I have already said about the making transparent, or clarifying of some
  bodies, as the white powder of beaten Glass, and the froth of some
  glutinous transparent liquor be well consider'd; for thereby it will seem
  rational to think that this transparency arises from the insinuation of
  the water (which has much the same refraction with such stony particles,
  as may be discover'd by Sand view'd with a <i>Microscope</i>) into those
  pores which were formerly repleat with air (that has a very differing
  refraction, and consequently is very reflective) which seems to be
  confirm'd by the second Observable, namely, the increase of weight after
  keeping, and decrease upon drying. And thirdly, seem'd yet more sensibly
  confirm'd by the multitude of bubbles in the last Experiment.</p>

  <p>We find also most Acid Salts very readily to dissolve and separate the
  parts of this body one from another; which is yet a further Argument to
  confirm the porousness of bodies, and will serve as such, to shew that
  even Glass also has an abundance of pores in it, since there are several
  liquors, that with long staying in a Glass, will so <i>Corrode</i> and
  eat into it, as at last, to make it pervious to the liquor it contain'd,
  of which I have seen very many Instances.</p>

  <p>Since therefore we find by other proofs, that many of those bodies
  which we think the most solid ones, and
  appear so to our sight, have notwithstanding abundance of those grosser
  kind of pores, which will admit several kinds of liquors into them, why
  should we not believe that Glass, and all other transparent bodies abound
  with them, since we have many other arguments, besides the propagation of
  light, which seem to argue for it?</p>

  <p>And whereas it may be objected, that the propagation of light is no
  argument that there are those atomical pores in glass, since there are
  <i>Hypotheses</i> plausible enough to solve those <i>Phænomena</i>, by
  supposing the pulse onely to be communicated through the transparent
  body.</p>

  <p>To this I answer, that that <i>Hypothesis</i> which the industrious
  <i>Mersennus</i> has publish'd about the slower motion of the end of a
  Ray in a denser <i>medium</i>, then in a more rare and thin, seems
  altogether unsufficient to solve abundance of <i>Phænomena</i>, of which
  this is not the least considerable, that it is impossible from that
  supposition, that any colours should be generated from the refraction of
  the Rays; for since by that <i>Hypothesis</i> the <i>undulating pulse</i>
  is always carried perpendicular, or at right angles with the Ray or Line
  of direction, it follows, that the stroke of the pulse of light, after it
  has been once or twice refracted (through a Prisme, for example) must
  affect the eye with the same kind of stroke as if it had not been
  refracted at all. Nor will it be enough for a Defendant of that
  <i>Hypothesis</i>, to say, that perhaps it is because the refractions
  have made the Rays more weak, for if so, then two refractions in the two
  parallel sides of a <i>Quadrangular Prisme</i> would produce colours, but
  we have no such <i>Phænomena</i> produc'd.</p>

  <p>There are several Arguments that I could bring to evince that there
  are in all transparent bodies such atomical pores. And that there is such
  a fluid body as I am arguing for, which is the <i>medium</i>, or
  Instrument, by which the pulse of Light is convey'd from the <i>lucid
  body</i> to the enlightn'd. But that it being a digression from the
  Observations I was recording, about the Pores of <i>Kettering Stone</i>,
  it would be too much such, if I should protract it too long; and
  therefore I shall proceed to the next <i>Observation</i>.</p>

<hr class="full" />

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXVI" id="obsXVI">XVI</a>. <i>Of </i>Charcoal<i>, or burnt </i>Vegetables<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Charcoal, or a Vegetable burnt black, affords an object no less
  pleasant than instructive, for if you take a small round Charcoal, and
  break it short with your fingers, you may perceive it to break with a
  very smooth and sleek surface, almost like the surface of black sealing
  Wax; this surface, if it be look'd on with an ordinary <i>Microscope</i>,
  does manifest abundance of those pores which are also visible to the eye
  in many kinds of <i>Wood</i>, rang'd round the pith, both a in kind of
  circular order, and a radiant one. Of these there are a multitude in the
  substance of the Coal, every where almost perforating and drilling it
  from end to end; by means of which, be the Coal
  never so long, you may easily blow through it; and this you may presently
  find, by wetting one end of it with Spittle, and blowing at the
  other.</p>

  <p>But this is not all, for besides those many great and conspicuous
  irregular spots or pores, if a better <i>Microscope</i> be made use of,
  there will appear an infinite company of exceedingly small, and very
  regular pores, so thick and so orderly set, and so close to one another,
  that they leave very little room or space between them to be fill'd with
  a solid body, for the apparent <i>interstitia</i> or separating sides of
  these pores seem so thin in some places, that the texture of a Honey-comb
  cannot be more porous. Though this be not every where so, the
  intercurrent partitions in some places being very much thicker in
  proportion to the holes.</p>

  <p>Most of these small pores seem'd to be pretty round, and were rang'd
  in rows that radiated from the pith to the bark; they all of them seem'd
  to be continued open pores, running the whole length of the Stick; and
  that they were all perforated, I try'd by breaking off a very thin sliver
  of the Coal cross-ways, and then with my <i>Microscope</i>, diligently
  surveying them against the light, for by that means I was able to see
  quite through them.</p>

  <p>These pores were so exceeding small and thick, that in a line of them,
  1/18 part of an Inch long, I found by numbring them no less then 150.
  small pores; and therefore in a line of them an Inch long, must be no
  less then 2700. pores, and in a circular <i>area</i> of an Inch diameter,
  must be about 5725350. of the like pores; so that a Stick of an Inch
  Diameter, may containe no less then seven hundred and twenty five
  thousand, besides 5 Millions of pores, which would, I doubt not, seem
  even incredible, were not every one left to believe his own eyes. Nay,
  having since examin'd <i>Cocus, black and green Ebony, Lignum Vitæ</i>,
  &amp;c. I found, that all these Woods have their pores, abundantly
  smaller then those of soft light Wood; in so much, that those of
  <i>Guajacum</i> seem'd not above an eighth part of the bigness of the
  pores of Beech, but then the <i>Interstitia</i> were thicker; so
  prodigiously curious are the contrivances, pipes, or sluces by which the
  <i>Succus nutritius</i>, or Juyce of a Vegetable is convey'd from place
  to place.</p>

  <p>This <i>Observation</i> seems to afford us the true reason of several
  <i>Phænomena</i> of Coals; as</p>

  <p>First, why they look black; and for this we need go no further then
  the <i>Scheme</i>, for certainly, a body that has so many pores in it as
  this is discover'd to have, from each of which no light is reflected,
  must necessarily look black, especially, when the pores are somewhat
  bigger in proportion to the intervals then they are cut in the
  <i>Scheme</i>, black being nothing else but a privation of Light, or a
  want of reflection; and wheresover this reflecting quality is deficient,
  there does that part look black, whether it be from a porousness of the
  body, as in this Instance, or in a deadning and dulling quality, such as
  I have observ'd in the <i>Scoria</i> of Lead, Tin, Silver, Copper,
  <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>Next, we may also as plainly see the reason of its shining quality,
  and that is from the even breaking off of the
  stick, the solid <i>interstitia</i> having a regular termination or
  surface, and having a pretty strong reflecting quality, the many small
  reflections become united to the naked eye, and make a very pretty
  shining surface.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, the reason of its hardness and brittleness seems evident, for
  since all the watery or liquid substance that moistn'd and toughn'd those
  <i>Interstitia</i> of the more solid parts, are evaporated and remov'd,
  that which is left behind becomes of the nature almost of a stone, which
  will not at all, or very little, bend without a <i>divulsion</i> or
  <i>solution</i> of its <i>continuity</i>.</p>

  <p>It is not my design at present, to examine the use and
  <i>Mechanisme</i> of these parts of Wood, that being more proper to
  another Enquiry; but rather to hint, that from this Experiment we may
  learn,</p>

  <p>First, what is the cause of the blackness of many burnt bodies, which
  we may find to be nothing else but this; that the heat of the fire
  agitating and rarifying the waterish, transparent, and volatile water
  that is contain'd in them, by the continuation of that action, does so
  totally expel and drive away all that which before fill'd the pores, and
  was dispers'd also through the solid mass of it, and thereby caus'd an
  universal kind of transparency, that it not onely leaves all the pores
  empty, but all the <i>Interstitia</i> also so dry and <i>opacous</i>, and
  perhaps also yet further perforated, that that light onely is reflected
  back which falls upon the very outward edges of the pores, all they that
  enter into the pores of the body, never returning, but being lost in
  it.</p>

  <p>Now, that the Charring or coaling of a body is nothing else, may be
  easily believ'd by one that shall consider the means of its production,
  which may be done after this, or any such manner. The body to be charr'd
  or coal'd, may be put into a <i>Crucible</i>, Pot, or any other Vessel
  that will endure to be made red-hot in the fire without breaking, and
  then cover'd over with Sand, so as no part of it be suffer'd to be open
  to the Air, then set into a good fire, and there kept till the Sand has
  continu'd red hot for a quarter, half, an hour or two, or more, according
  to the nature and bigness of the body to be coal'd or charr'd, then
  taking it out of the fire, and letting it stand till it be quite cold,
  the body may be taken out of the Sand well charr'd and cleans'd of its
  waterish parts; but in the taking of it out, care must be had that the
  Sand be very neer cold, for else, when it comes into the free air, it
  will take fire, and readily burn away.</p>

  <p>This maybe done also in any close Vessel of Glass, as a <i>Retort</i>,
  or the like, and the several fluid substances that come over may be
  receiv'd in a fit <i>Recipient</i>, which will yet further countenance
  this <i>Hypothesis</i>: And their manner of charring Wood in great
  quantity comes much to the same thing, namely, an application of a great
  heat to the body, and preserving it from the free access of the devouring
  air; this may be easily learn'd from the History of Charring of Coal,
  most excellently describ'd and publish'd by that most accomplish'd
  Gentleman, Mr. <i>John Evelin</i>, in the 100, 101, 103, pages of his
  <i>Sylva</i>, to which I shall therefore refer the curious Reader that
  desires a full information of it.</p>

  <p>Next, we may learn what part of the Wood it is that is the
  <i>combustible</i> matter, for since we shall find that none, or very
  little of those fluid substances that are driven over into the Receiver
  are <i>combustible</i>, and that most of that which is left behind is so,
  it follows, that the solid <i>interstitia</i> of the Wood are the
  <i>combustible</i> matter. Further, the reason why uncharr'd Wood burns
  with a greater flame then that which is charr'd, is as evident, because
  those waterish or volatil parts issuing out of the fired Wood, every way,
  not onely shatter and open the body, the better for the fire to enter,
  but issuing out in vapours or wind, they become like so many little
  <i>æolipiles</i>, or Bellows, whereby they blow and agitate the fir'd
  part, and conduce to the more speedy and violent consumption or
  dissolution of the body.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, from the Experiment of charring of Coals (whereby we see that
  notwithstanding the great heat, and the duration of it, the solid parts
  of the Wood remain, whilest they are preserv'd from the free access of
  the air undissipated) we may learn, that which has not, that I know of,
  been publish'd or hinted, nay, not so much as thought of, by any; and
  that in short is this.</p>

  <p>First, <i>that the Air</i> in which we live, move, and breath, and
  which encompasses very many, and cherishes most bodies it encompasses,
  that this Air is the <i>menstruum</i>, or universal dissolvent of all
  <i>Sulphureous</i> bodies.</p>

  <p>Secondly, <i>that this action</i> it performs not, till the body be
  first sufficiently heated, as we find requisite also to the dissolution
  of many other bodies by several other <i>menstruums</i>.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, <i>that this action</i> of dissolution, produces or generates
  a very great heat, and that which we call Fire; and this is common also
  to many dissolutions of other bodies, made by <i>menstruums</i>, of which
  I could give multitudes of Instances.</p>

  <p>Fourthly, <i>that this action</i> is perform'd with so great a
  violence, and does so minutely act, and rapidly agitate the smallest
  parts of the <i>combustible</i> matter, that it produces in the
  <i>diaphanous medium</i> of the Air, the action or pulse of light, which
  what it is, I have else-where already shewn.</p>

  <p>Fifthly, <i>that the dissolution</i> of sulphureous bodies is made by
  a substance inherent, and mixt with the Air, that is like, if not the
  very same, with that which is fixt in <i>Salt-peter</i>, which by
  multitudes of Experiments that may be made with <i>Saltpeter</i>, will, I
  think, most evidently be demonstrated.</p>

  <p>Sixthly, <i>that in this dissolution</i> of bodies by the Air, a
  certain part is united and mixt, or dissolv'd and turn'd into the Air,
  and made to fly up and down with it in the same manner as a
  <i>metalline</i> or other body dissolved into any <i>menstruums</i>, does
  follow the motions and progresses of that <i>menstruum</i> till it be
  precipitated.</p>

  <p>Seventhly, That as there is one part that is dissoluble by the Air, so
  are there other parts with which the parts of the Air mixing and uniting,
  do make a <i>Coagulum</i>, or <i>precipitation</i>, as one may call it,
  which causes it to be separated from the Air, but this <i>precipitate</i>
  is so light, and in so small and rarify'd or porous clusters, that it is
  very volatil, and is easily carry'd up by the motion of the Air, though
  afterwards, when the heat and agitation that kept it
  rarify'd ceases, it easily condenses, and commixt with other indissoluble
  parts, it sticks and adheres to the next bodies it meets withall; and
  this is a certain <i>Salt</i> that may be extracted out of
  <i>Soot</i>.</p>

  <p>Eighthly, that many indissoluble parts being very apt and prompt to be
  rarify'd, and so, whilest they continue in that heat and agitation, are
  lighter then the Ambient Air, are thereby thrust and carry'd upwards with
  great violence, and by that means carry along with them, not onely that
  <i>Saline concrete</i> I mention'd before, but many terrestrial, or
  indissoluble and irrarefiable parts, nay, many parts also which are
  dissoluble, but are not suffer'd to stay long enough in a sufficient heat
  to make them prompt and apt for that action. And therefore we find in
  <i>Soot</i>, not onely a part, that being continued longer in a competent
  heat, will be dissolv'd by the Air, or take fire and burn; but a part
  also which is fixt, terrestrial, and irrarefiable.</p>

  <p>Ninthly, that as there are these several parts that will rarifie and
  fly, or be driven up by the heat, so are there many others, that as they
  are indissoluble by the <i>aerial menstruum</i>, so are they of such
  sluggish and gross parts, that they are not easily rarify'd by heat, and
  therefore cannot be rais'd by it; the volatility or fixtness of a body
  seeming to consist only in this, that the one is of a texture, or has
  component parts that will be easily rarify'd into the form of Air, and
  the other, that it has such as will not, without much ado, be brought to
  such a constitution; and this is that part which remains behind in a
  white body call'd Ashes, which contains a substance, or <i>Salt</i>,
  which Chymists call <i>Alkali</i>: what the particular natures of each of
  these bodies are, I shall not here examine, intending it in another
  place, but shall rather add that this <i>Hypothesis</i> does so exactly
  agree with all <i>Phænomena</i>, of Fire, and so genuinely explicate each
  particular circumstance that I have hitherto observ'd, that it is more
  then probable, that this cause which I have assign'd is the true
  adequate, real, and onely cause of those <i>Phænomena</i>; And therefore
  I shall proceed a little further, to shew the nature and use of the
  Air.</p>

  <p>Tenthly, therefore the dissolving parts of the Air are but few, that
  is, it seems of the nature of those <i>Saline menstruums</i>, or spirits,
  that have very much flegme mixt with the spirits, and therefore a small
  parcel of it is quickly glutted, and will dissolve no more; and therefore
  unless some fresh part of this <i>menstruum</i> be apply'd to the body to
  be dissolv'd, the action ceases, and the body leaves to be dissolv'd and
  to shine, which is the Indication of it, though plac'd or kept in the
  greatest heat; whereas <i>Salt-peter</i> is a <i>menstruum</i>, when
  melted and red-hot, that abounds more with those Dissolvent particles,
  and therefore as a small quantity of it will dissolve a great sulphureous
  body, so will the dissolution be very quick and violent.</p>

  <p>Therefore in the <i>Eleventh</i> place, it is observable, that, as in
  other solutions, if a copious and quick supply of fresh <i>menstruum</i>,
  though but weak, be poured on, or applied to the dissoluble body, it
  quickly consumes it: So this <i>menstruum</i> of the Air, if by Bellows,
  or any other such contrivance, it be copiously apply'd to the shining
  body, is found to dissolve it as soon, and as
  violently as the more strong <i>menstruum</i> of melted <i>Nitre</i>.</p>

  <p>Therefore twelfthly, it seems reasonable to think that there is no
  such thing as an Element of Fire that should attract or draw up the
  flame, or towards which the flame should endeavour to ascend out of a
  desire or appetite of uniting with that as its <i>Homogeneal</i>
  primitive and generating Element; but that that shining transient body
  which we call <i>Flame</i>, is nothing else but a mixture of Air, and
  volatil sulphureous parts of dissoluble or combustible bodies, which are
  acting upon each other whilst they ascend, that is, flame seems to be a
  mixture of Air, and the combustible volatil parts of any body, which
  parts the encompassing Air does dissolve or work upon, which action, as
  it does intend the heat of the <i>aerial</i> parts of the dissolvent, so
  does it thereby further rarifie those parts that are acting, or that are
  very neer them, whereby they growing much lighter then the heavie parts
  of that <i>menstruum</i> that are more remote, are thereby protruded and
  driven upward; and this may be easily observ'd also in dissolution made
  by any other <i>menstruum</i>, especially such as either create heat or
  bubbles. Now, this action of the <i>menstruum</i>, or <i>Air</i>, on the
  dissoluble parts, is made with such violence, or is such, that it imparts
  such a motion or pulse to the <i>diaphanous</i> parts of the Air, as I
  have elsewhere shewn is requisite to produce light.</p>

  <p>This <i>Hypothesis</i> I have endeavoured to raise from an Infinite of
  Observations and Experiments, the process of which would be much too long
  to be here inserted, and will perhaps another time afford matter copious
  enough for a much larger Discourse, the Air being a Subject which (though
  all the world has hitherto liv'd and breath'd in, and been unconversant
  about) has yet been so little truly examin'd or explain'd, that a
  diligent enquirer will be able to find but very little information from
  what has been (till of late) written of it: But being once well
  understood, it will, I doubt not, inable a man to render an intelligible,
  nay probable, if not the true reason of all the <i>Phænomena</i> of Fire,
  which, as it has been found by Writers and Philosophers of all Ages a
  matter of no small difficulty, as may be sufficiently understood by their
  strange <i>Hypotheses</i>, and unintelligible Solutions of some few
  <i>Phænomena</i> of it; so will it prove a matter of no small concern and
  use in humane affairs, as I shall elsewhere endeavour to manifest when I
  come to shew the use of the Air in respiration, and for the preservation
  of the life, nay, for the conservation and restauration of the health and
  natural constitution of mankind as well as all other aereal
  <i>animals</i>, as also the uses of this principle or propriety of the
  Air in chymical, mechanical, and other operations. In this place I have
  onely time to hint an <i>Hypothesis</i>, which, if God permit me life and
  opportunity, I may elsewhere prosecute, improve and publish. In the mean
  time, before I finish this Discourse, I must not forget to acquaint the
  Reader, that having had the liberty granted me of making some trials on a
  piece of <i>Lignum fossile</i> shewn to the Royal Society, by the
  eminently Ingenious and Learned Physician, Doctor <i>Ent</i>, who
  receiv'd it for a Present from the famous <i>Ingenioso Cavalliero de
  Pozzi</i>, it being one of the fairest and best
  pieces of <i>Lignum fossile</i> he had seen; Having (I say) taken a small
  piece of this Wood, and examin'd it, I found it to burn in the open Air
  almost like other Wood, and insteed of a resinous smoak or fume, it
  yielded a very bituminous one, smelling much of that kind of sent: But
  that which I chiefly took notice of, was, that cutting off a small piece
  of it, about the bigness of my Thumb, and charring it in a
  <i>Crucible</i> with Sand, after the manner I above prescrib'd, I found
  it infinitely to abound with the smaller sort of pores, so extreamly
  thick, and so regularly perforating the substance of it long-ways, that
  breaking it off a-cross, I found it to look very like an Honey-comb; but
  as for any of the second, or bigger kind of pores, I could not find that
  it had any; so that it seems, whatever were the cause of its production,
  it was not without those small kind of pores which we have onely hitherto
  found in Vegetable bodies: and comparing them with the pores which I have
  found in the Charcoals that I by this means made of several other kinds
  of Wood, I find it resemble none so much as those of Fire, to which it is
  not much unlike in grain also, and several other proprieties.</p>

  <p>And therefore, what ever is by some, who have written of it, and
  particularly by <i>Francisco Stelluto</i>, wrote a Treatise in
  <i>Italian</i> of that Subject, which was Printed at <i>Rome</i>, 1637,
  affirm'd that it is a certain kind of Clay or Earth, which in tract of
  time is turn'd into Wood; I rather suspect the quite contrary, that it
  was at first certain great Trees of Fir or Pine, which by some
  Earthquake, or other casualty, came to be buried under the Earth, and was
  there, after a long time's residence (according to the several natures of
  the encompassing adjacent parts) either rotted and turn'd into a kind of
  Clay, or <i>petrify'd</i> and turn'd into a kind of Stone, or else had
  its pores fill'd with certain Mineral juices, which being stay'd in them,
  and in tract of time coagulated, appear'd, upon cleaving out, like small
  Metaline Wires, or else from some flames or scorching forms that are the
  occasion oftentimes, and usually accompany Earthquakes, might be blasted
  and turn'd into Coal, or else from certain <i>subterraneous</i> fires
  which are affirm'd by that Authour to abound much about those parts
  (namely, in a Province of <i>Italy</i>, call'd <i>Umbria</i>, now the
  <i>Dutchie</i> of <i>Spoletto</i>, in the Territory of <i>Todi</i>,
  anciently call'd <i>Tudor</i>; and between the two Villages of
  <i>Collesecco</i> and <i>Rosaro</i> not far distant from the high-way
  leading to <i>Rome</i>, where it is found in greater quantity then
  elsewhere) are by reason of their being encompassed with Earth, and so
  kept close from the dissolving Air, charr'd and converted into Coal. It
  would be too long a work to describe the several kinds of pores which I
  met withall, and by this means discovered in several other Vegetable
  bodies; nor is it my present design to expatiate upon Instances of the
  same kind, but rather to give a Specimen of as many kinds as I have had
  opportunity as yet of observing, reserving the prosecution and enlarging
  on particulars till a more fit opportunity; and in prosecution of this
  design, I shall here add:</p>

  <br clear="all" />
<hr class="full" />

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXVII" id="obsXVII">XVII</a>. <i>Of </i>Petrify'd wood<i>, and other </i>Petrify'd bodies<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Of this sort of substance, I observ'd several pieces of very differing
  kinds, both for their outward shape, colour, grain, <i>texture</i>,
  hardness, <i>&amp;c.</i> some being brown and redish; others gray, like a
  Hone; others black, and Flint-like: some soft, like a Slate or Whetstone,
  others as hard as a Flint, and as brittle. That which I more particular
  examin'd, was a piece about the bigness of a mans hand, which seem'd to
  have been a part of some large tree, that by rottenness had been broken
  off from it before it began to be <i>petrify'd</i>.</p>

  <p>And indeed, all that I have yet seen, seem to have been rotten Wood
  before the petrifaction was begun; and not long since, examining and
  viewing a huge great <i>Oak</i>, that seem'd with meer age to be rotten
  as it stood, I was very much confirm'd in this opinion; for I found, that
  the grain, colour, and shape of the Wood, was exactly like this
  <i>petrify'd</i> substance; and with a <i>Microscope</i>, I found, that
  all those <i>Microscopical</i> pores, which in sappy or firm and sound
  Wood are fill'd with the natural or innate juices of those Vegetables, in
  this they were all empty, like those of <i>Vegetables charr'd</i>; but
  with this difference, that they seem'd much larger then I have seen any
  in <i>Char-coals</i>; nay, even then those of Coals made of great blocks
  of Timber, which are commonly call'd <i>Old-coals</i>.</p>

  <p>The reason of which difference may probably be, that the charring of
  Vegetables, being an operation quickly perform'd, and whilest the Wood is
  sappy, the more solid parts may more easily shrink together, and contract
  the pores or <i>interstitia</i> between them, then in the rotten Wood,
  where that natural juice seems onely to be wash'd away by
  <i>adventitious</i> or unnatural moisture; and so though the natural
  juice be wasted from between the firm parts, yet those parts are kept
  asunder by the <i>adventitious</i> moystures, and so by degrees settled
  in those postures.</p>

  <p>And this I likewise found in the <i>petrify'd</i> Wood, that the pores
  were somewat bigger then those of <i>Charcoal</i>, each pore being neer
  upon half as bigg again, but they did not bear that disproportion which
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-10.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 10.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 1, 2.
</span>
  is exprest in the tenth <i>Scheme</i>, between the small specks or pores
  in the first Figure (which representeth the pores of Coal or Wood
  charr'd) and the black spots of the second Figure (which represent the
  like <i>Microscopical pores</i> in the <i>petrify'd</i> Wood) for these
  last were drawn by a <i>Microscope</i> that magnify'd the object above
  six times more in Diameter then the <i>Microscope</i> by which those
  pores of Coal were observ'd.</p>

  <p>Now, though they were a little bigger, yet did they keep the exact
  figure and order of the pores of Coals and of rotten Wood, which last
  also were much of the same cize.</p>

  <p>The other Observations on this <i>petrify'd</i> substance, that a
  while since, by the appointment of the <i>Royal Society</i>, I made, and
  presented to them an account of, were these that follow, which had the
  honour done them by the most accomplish'd Mr. <i>Evelin</i>,
  my highly honoured friend, to be inserted and published among those
  excellent Observations wherewith his <i>Sylva</i> is replenish'd, and
  would therefore have been here omitted, had not the Figure of them, as
  they appear'd through the <i>Microscope</i> been before that
  engraven.</p>

  <p>This <i>Petrify'd</i> substance resembled Wood, in that</p>

  <p>First, all the parts of it seem'd not at all <i>dislocated</i>, or
  alter'd from their natural Position, whil'st they were Wood, but the
  whole piece retain'd the exact shape of Wood, having many of the
  conspicuous pores of wood still remaining pores, and shewing a manifest
  difference visible enough between the grain of the Wood and that of the
  bark, especially when any side of it was cut smooth and polite; for then
  it appear'd to have a very lovely grain, like that of some curious close
  Wood.</p>

  <p>Next (it resembled Wood) in that all the smaller and (if I may so call
  those which are onely visible with a good magnifying Glass)
  <i>Microscopical</i> pores of it appear (both when the substance is cut
  and polish'd <i>transversly</i> and <i>parallel</i> to the pores of it)
  perfectly like the <i>Microscopical</i> pores of several kinds of Wood,
  especially like and equal to those of several sorts of rotten Wood which
  I have since observ'd, retaining both the shape, position and magnitude
  of such pores. It was differing from Wood:</p>

  <p>First; in <i>weight</i>, being to common water as 3¼ to 1. whereas
  there are few of our <i>English</i> Woods, that when very dry are found
  to be full as heavie as water.</p>

  <p>Secondly, in <i>hardness</i>, being very neer as hard as a Flint; and
  in some places of it also resembling the grain of a Flint: and, like it,
  it would very readily cut Glass, and would not without difficulty,
  especially in some parts of it, be scratch'd by a black hard Flint: It
  would also as readily strike fire against a Steel, or against a Flint, as
  any common Flint.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, in the <i>closeness</i> of it, for though all the
  <i>Microscopical</i> pores of this <i>petrify'd</i> substance were very
  conspicuous in one position, yet by altering that position of the
  polish'd surface to the light, it was also manifest, that those pores
  appear'd darker then the rest of the body, onely because they were fill'd
  up with a more duskie substance, and not because they were hollow.</p>

  <p>Fourthly, in its <i>incombustibleness</i>, in that it would not burn
  in the fire; nay, though I kept it a good while red-hot in the flame of a
  Lamp, made very <i>intense</i> by the blast of a small Pipe, and a large
  Charcoal, yet it seem'd not at all to have diminish'd its extension; but
  only I found it to have chang'd its colour, and to appear of a more dark
  and duskie brown colour; nor could I perceive that those parts which
  seem'd to have been Wood at first, were any thing wasted, but the parts
  appear'd as solid and close as before. It was further observable also,
  that as it did not consume like Wood, so neither did it crack and flie
  like a Flint, or such like hard Stone, nor was it long before it appear'd
  red-hot.</p>

  <p>Fifthly, in its <i>dissolubleness</i>; for putting some drops of
  distill'd <i>Vinegar</i> upon the Stone, I found it presently to yield
  very many Bubbles, just like those which may be observ'd in spirit of
  <i>Vinegar</i> when it corrodes <i>corals</i>, though
  perhaps many of those small Bubbles might proceed from some small parcels
  of Air which were driven out of the pores of this <i>petrify'd</i>
  substance by the insinuating liquid <i>menstruum</i>.</p>

  <p>Sixthly, in its <i>rigidness</i>, and <i>friability</i>, being not at
  all flexible but brittle like a Flint, insomuch that I could with one
  knock of a Hammer break off a piece of it, and with a few more, reduce
  that into a pretty fine powder.</p>

  <p>Seventhly, it seem'd also very differing from Wood to the
  <i>touch</i>, <i>feeling</i> more cold then Wood usually does, and much
  like other close stones and Minerals.</p>

  <p>The Reasons of all which <i>Phænomena</i> seem to be,</p>

  <p>That <i>petrify'd</i> Wood having lain in some place where it was well
  soak'd with <i>petrifying</i> water (that is, such a water as is well
  <i>impregnated</i> with stony and earthy particles) did by degrees
  separate, either by straining and <i>filtration</i>, or perhaps, by
  <i>precipitation</i>, <i>cohesion</i> or <i>coagulation</i>, abundance of
  stony particles from the permeating water, which stony particles, being
  by means of the fluid <i>vehicle</i> convey'd, not onely into the
  <i>Microscopical</i> pores, and so perfectly stoping them up, but also
  into the pores or <i>interstitia</i>, which may, perhaps, be even in the
  texture or <i>Schematisme</i> of that part of the Wood, which, through
  the <i>Microscope</i>, appears most solid, do thereby so augment the
  weight of the Wood, as to make it above three times heavier then water,
  and perhaps, six times as heavie as it was when Wood.</p>

  <p>Next, they thereby so lock up and fetter the parts of the Wood, that
  the fire cannot easily make them flie away, but the action of the fire
  upon them is onely able to <i>Char</i> those parts, as it were, like a
  piece of Wood, if it be clos'd very fast up in Clay, and kept a good
  while red-hot in the fire, will by the heat of the fire be charr'd and
  not consum'd, which may, perhaps, also be somewhat of the cause, why the
  <i>petrify'd</i> substance appear'd of a dark brown colour after it had
  been burnt.</p>

  <p>By this <i>intrusion</i> of the <i>petrifying</i> particles, this
  substance also becomes hard and <i>friable</i>; for the smaller pores of
  the Wood being perfectly wedg'd, and stuft up with those stony particles,
  the small parts of the Wood have no places or pores into which they may
  slide upon bending, and consequently little or no flexion or yielding at
  all can be caus'd in such a substance.</p>

  <p>The remaining particles likewise of the Wood among the stony
  particles, may keep them from cracking and flying when put into the fire,
  as they are very apt to do in a Flint.</p>

  <p>Nor is Wood the onely substance that may by this kind of
  <i>transmutation</i> be chang'd into stone; for I my self have seen and
  examin'd very many kinds of substances, and among very credible Authours,
  we may meet with Histories of such <i>Metamorphoses</i> wrought almost on
  all kind of substances, both <i>Vegetable</i> and <i>Animal</i>, which
  Histories, it is not my business at present, either to relate, or
  <i>epitomise</i>, but only to set down some Observation I lately made on
  several kind of <i>petrify'd</i> Shels, found about <i>Keinsham</i>,
  which lies within four or five miles of <i>Bristol</i>, which are
  commonly call'd <i>Serpentine-stones.</i></p>

  <p>Examining several of these very curiously figur'd bodies (which are
  commonly thought to be Stones form'd by some extraordinary <i>Plastick
  virtue</i> <i>latent</i> in the Earth itself) I took notice of these
  particulars:</p>

  <p>First, that these figured bodies, or stones, were of very differing
  substances, as to hardness: some of Clay, some Marle, some soft Stone,
  almost of the hardness of those soft stones which Masons call Fire-stone,
  others as hard as Portland stone, others as hard as Marble, and some as
  hard as a Flint or Crystal.</p>

  <p>Next, they were of very differing substances as to transparency and
  colour; some white, some almost black, some brown, some Metalline, or
  like Marchasites; some transparent like white Marble, others like flaw'd
  Crystal, some gray, some of divers colours; some radiated like those long
  <i>petrify'd drops</i>, which are commonly found at the <i>Peak</i>, and
  in other <i>subterraneous caverns</i>, which have a kind of pith in the
  middle.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, that they were very different as to the manner of their
  outward figuration; for some of them seem'd to have been the substance
  that had fill'd the Shell of some kind of Shel-fish; others, to have been
  the substance that had contain'd or enwrapp'd one of those Shels, on both
  which, the perfect impression either of the inside or outside of such
  Shells seem'd to be left, but for the most part, those impressions seem'd
  to be made by an imperfect or broken Shell, the great end or mouth of the
  Shell being always wanting, and often times the little end, and sometimes
  half, and in some there were impressions, just as if there had been holes
  broken in the figurating, imprinting or moulding Shell; some of them
  seem'd to be made by such a Shell very much brused or flaw'd, insomuch
  that one would verily have thought that very figur'd stone had been
  broken or brused whilst a gelly, as 'twere, and so hardned, but within in
  the grain of the stone, there appear'd not the least sign of any such
  bruse or breaking, but onely on the very uttermost superficies.</p>

  <p>Fourthly, they were very different, as to their outward covering, some
  having the perfect Shell, both in figure, colour, and substance, sticking
  on upon its surface, and adhering to it, but might very easily be
  separated from it, and like other common <i>Cockle</i> or
  <i>Scolop-shels</i>, which some of them most accurately resembled, were
  very dissoluble in common <i>Vinegar</i>, others of them, especially
  those <i>Serpentine</i>, or <i>Helical stones</i> were cover'd or
  retained the shining or Pearl-colour'd substance of the inside of a Shel,
  which substance, on some parts of them, was exceeding thin, and might
  very easily be rubbed off; on other parts it was pretty thick, and
  retained a white coat, or flaky substance on the top, just like the
  outsides of such Shells; some of them had very large pieces of the Shell
  very plainly sticking on to them, which were easily to be broken or
  flaked off by degrees: they likewise, some of them retain'd all along the
  surface of them very pretty kind of <i>sutures</i>, such as are observ'd
  in the skulls of several kinds of living creatures, which <i>sutures</i>
  were most curiously shap'd in the manner of leaves, and every one of them
  in the same Shell, exactly one like another, which I was able to discover
  plainly enough with my naked eye, but more perfectly and distinctly with
  my <i>Microscope</i>; all these sutures, by breaking
  some of these stones, I found to be the <i>termini</i>, or boundings of
  certain <i>diaphragms</i>, or partitions, which seem'd to divide the
  cavity of the Shell into a multitude of very proportionate and regular
  <i>cells</i> or <i>caverns</i>, these <i>Diaphragms</i>, in many of them,
  I found very perfect and compleat, of a very distinct substance from that
  which fill'd the cavities, and exactly of the same kind with that which
  covered the outside, being for the most part whitish, or
  <i>mother-of-pearl</i> colour'd.</p>

  <p>As for the cavities between those <i>Diaphragms</i>, I found some of
  them fill'd with Marle, and others with several kinds of stones, others,
  for the most part hollow, onely the whole cavity was usually covered over
  with a kind of <i>tartareous petrify'd</i> substance, which stuck about
  the sides, and was there shot into very curious regular Figures, just as
  <i>Tartar</i>, or other dissolv'd Salts are observ'd to stick and
  <i>crystallize</i> about the sides of the containing Vessels; or like
  those little <i>Diamants</i> which I before observed to have covered the
  vaulted cavity of a Flint; others had these cavities all lin'd with a
  kind of <i>metalline</i> or <i>marchasite-like</i> substance, which with
  a <i>Microscope</i> I could as plainly see most curiously and regularly
  figured, as I had done those in a Flint.</p>

  <p>From all which, and several other particulars which I observ'd, I
  cannot but think, that all these, and most other kinds of stony bodies
  which are found thus strangely figured, do owe their formation and
  figuration, not to any kind of <i>Plastick virtue</i> inherent in the
  earth, but to the Shells of certain Shel-fishes, which, either by some
  Deluge, Inundation, Earthquake, or some such other means, came to be
  thrown to that place, and there to be fill'd with some kind of Mudd or
  Clay, or <i>petrifying</i> Water, or some other substance, which in tract
  of time has been settled together and hardned in those shelly moulds into
  those shaped substances we now find them; that the great and thin end of
  these Shells by that Earthquake, or what ever other extraordinary cause
  it was that brought them thither, was broken off; and that many others
  were otherwise broken, bruised and disfigured; that these Shells which
  are thus <i>spirallied</i> and separated with <i>Diaphragmes</i>, were
  some kind of <i>Nautili</i> or <i>Porcelane shells</i>; and that others
  were shells of <i>Cockles</i>, <i>Muscles</i>, <i>Periwincles</i>,
  <i>Scolops</i>, &amp;c. of various sorts; that these Shells in many, from
  the particular nature of the containing or enclos'd Earth, or some other
  cause, have in tract of time rotted and mouldred away, and onely left
  their impressions, both on the containing and contained substances; and
  so left them pretty loose one within another, so that they may be easily
  separated by a knock or two of a Hammer. That others of these Shells,
  according to the nature of the substances adjacent to them, have, by a
  long continuance in that posture, been <i>petrify'd</i> and turn'd into
  the nature of stone, just as I even now observ'd several sorts of Wood to
  be. That oftentimes the Shell may be found with one kind of substance
  within, and quite another without; having, perhaps, been fill'd in one
  place, and afterwards translated to another, which I have very frequently
  observ'd in <i>Cockle</i>, <i>Muscle</i>, <i>Periwincle</i>, and other
  shells, which I have found by the Sea side. Nay, further, that some parts
  of the same Shell may be fill'd in one place, and some
  other caverns in another, and others in a third, or a fourth, or a fifth
  place, for so many differing substances have I found in one of these
  <i>petrify'd</i> Shells, and perhaps all these differing from the
  encompassing earth or stone; the means how all which varieties may be
  caus'd, I think, will not be difficult to conceive, to any one that has
  taken notice of those Shells, which are commonly found on the Sea shore:
  And he that shall throughly examine several kinds of such curiously
  form'd stones, will (I am very apt to think) find reason to suppose their
  generation or formation to be ascribable to some such accidents as I have
  mention'd, and not to any <i>Plastick virtue</i>: For it seems to me
  quite contrary to the infinite prudence of Nature, which is observable in
  all its works and productions, to design every thing to a determinate
  end, and for the attaining of that end, makes use of such ways as are (as
  farr as the knowledge of man has yet been able to reach) altogether
  consonant, and most agreeable to man's reason, and of no way or means
  that does contradict, or is contrary to humane Ratiocination; whence it
  has a long time been a general observation and <i>maxime</i>, that
  <i>Nature does nothing in vain</i>; It seems, I say, contrary to that
  great Wisdom of Nature, that these prettily shap'd bodies should have all
  those curious Figures and contrivances (which many of them are adorn'd
  and contriv'd with) generated or wrought by a <i>Plastick virtue</i>, for
  no higher end, then onely to exhibite such a form; which he that shall
  throughly consider all the circumstances of such kind of Figur'd bodies,
  will, I think, have great reason to believe, though, I confess, one
  cannot presently be able to find out what Nature's designs are. It were
  therefore very desirable, that a good collection of such kind of figur'd
  stones were collected; and as many particulars, circumstances, and
  informations collected with them as could be obtained, that from such a
  History of Observations well rang'd, examin'd and digested, the true
  original or production of all those kinds of stones might be perfectly
  and surely known; such as are <i>Thunder-stones</i>, <i>Lapides
  Stellares</i>, <i>Lapides Judaici</i>, and multitudes of other, whereof
  mention is made in <i>Aldonandus</i>, <i>Wormius</i>, and other Writers
  of Minerals.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXVIII" id="obsXVIII">XVIII</a>. <i>Of the </i>Schematisme<i> or </i>Texture<i> of </i>Cork<i>, and
of the Cells and Pores of some other such frothy Bodies.</i></h3>

  <p>I took a good clear piece of Cork, and with a Pen-knife sharpen'd as
  keen as a Razor, I cut a piece of it off, and thereby left the surface of
  it exceeding smooth, then examining it very diligently with a
  <i>Microscope</i>, me thought I could perceive it to appear a little
  porous; but I could not so plainly distinguish them, as to be sure that
  they were pores, much less what Figure they were of: But judging from the
  lightness and yielding quality of the Cork, that certainly the texture
  could not be so curious, but that possibly, if I could use
  some further diligence, I might find it to be discernable with a
  <i>Microscope</i>, I with the same sharp Penknife, cut off from the
  former smooth surface an exceeding thin piece of it, and placing it on a
  black object Plate, because it was it self a white body, and casting the
  light on it with a deep <i>plano-convex Glass</i>, I could exceeding
  plainly perceive it to be all perforated and porous, much like a
  Honey-comb, but that the pores of it were not regular; yet it was not
  unlike a Honey-comb in these particulars.</p>

  <p>First, in that it had a very little solid substance, in comparison of
  the empty cavity that was contain'd between, as does more manifestly
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-11.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 11.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 1.
</span>
  appear by the Figure A and B of the XI. <i>Scheme</i>, for the
  <i>Interstitia</i>, or walls (as I may so call them) or partitions of
  those pores were neer as thin in proportion to their pores, as those thin
  films of Wax in a Honey-comb (which enclose and constitute the
  <i>sexangular celts</i>) are to theirs.</p>

  <p>Next, in that these pores, or cells, were not very deep, but consisted
  of a great many little Boxes, separated out of one continued long pore,
  by certain <i>Diaphragms</i>, as is visible by the Figure B, which
  represents a sight of those pores split the long-ways.</p>

  <p>I no sooner discern'd these (which were indeed the first
  <i>microscopical</i> pores I ever saw, and perhaps, that were ever seen,
  for I had not met with any Writer or Person, that had made any mention of
  them before this) but me thought I had with the discovery of them,
  presently hinted to me the true and intelligible reason of all the
  <i>Phænomena</i> of Cork; As,</p>

  <p>First, if I enquir'd why it was so exceeding light a body? my
  <i>Microscope</i> could presently inform me that here was the same reason
  evident that there is found for the lightness of froth, an empty
  Honey-comb, Wool, a Spunge, a Pumice-stone, or the like; namely, a very
  small quantity of a solid body, extended into exceeding large
  dimensions.</p>

  <p>Next, it seem'd nothing more difficult to give an intelligible reason,
  why Cork is a body so very unapt to suck and drink in Water, and
  consequently preserves it self, floating on the top of Water, though left
  on it never so long: and why it is able to stop and hold air in a Bottle,
  though it be there very much condens'd and consequently presses very
  strongly to get a passage out, without suffering the least bubble to pass
  through its substance. For, as to the first, since our <i>Microscope</i>
  informs us that the substance of Cork is altogether fill'd with Air, and
  that that Air is perfectly enclosed in little Boxes or Cells distinct
  from one another. It seems very plain, why neither the Water, nor any
  other Air can easily insinuate it self into them, since there is already
  within them an <i>intus existens</i>, and consequently, why the pieces of
  Cork become so good floats for Nets, and stopples for Viols, or other
  close Vessels.</p>

  <p>And thirdly, if we enquire why Cork has such a springiness and
  swelling nature when compress'd? and how it comes to suffer so great a
  compression, or seeming penetration of dimensions, so as to be made a
  substance as heavie again and more, bulk for bulk, as it was before
  compression, and yet suffer'd to return, is found to extend it self again
  into the same space? Our <i>Microscope</i> will easily inform us, that
  the whole mass consists of an infinite company of small
  Boxes or Bladders of Air, which is a substance of a springy nature, and
  that will suffer a considerable condensation (as I have several times
  found by divers trials, by which I have most evidently condens'd it into
  less then a twentieth part of its usual dimensions neer the Earth, and
  that with no other strength then that of my hands without any kind of
  forcing Engine, such as Racks, Leavers, Wheels, Pullies, or the like, but
  this onely by and by) and besides, it seems very probable that those very
  films or sides of the pores, have in them a springing quality, as almost
  all other kind of Vegetable substances have, so as to help to restore
  themselves to their former position.</p>

  <p>And could we so easily and certainly discover the <i>Schematisme</i>
  and <i>Texture</i> even of these films, and of several other bodies, as
  we can these of Cork; there seems no probable reason to the contrary, but
  that we might as readily render the true reason of all their
  <i>Phænomena</i>; as namely, what were the cause of the springingess, and
  toughness of some, both as to their flexibility and restitution. What, of
  the friability or brittleness of some others, and the like; but till such
  time as our <i>Microscope</i>, or some other means, enable us to discover
  the true <i>Schematism</i> and <i>Texture</i> of all kinds of bodies, we
  must grope, as it were, in the dark, and onely ghess at the true reasons
  of things by similitudes and comparisons.</p>

  <p>But, to return to our Observation. I told several lines of these
  pores, and found that there were usually about threescore of these small
  Cells placed end-ways in the eighteenth part of an Inch in length, whence
  I concluded there must be neer eleven hundred of them, or somewhat more
  then a thousand in the length of an Inch, and therefore in a square Inch
  above a Million, or 1166400. and in a Cubick Inch, above twelve hundred
  Millions, or 1259712000. a thing almost incredible, did not our
  <i>Microscope</i> assure us of it by ocular demonstration; nay, did it
  not discover to us the pores of a body, which were they
  <i>diaphragm'd</i>, like those of Cork, would afford us in one Cubick
  Inch, more then ten times as many little Cells, as is evident in several
  charr'd Vegetables; so prodigiously curious are the works of Nature, that
  even these conspicuous pores of bodies, which seem to be the channels or
  pipes through which the <i>Succus nutritius</i>, or natural juices of
  Vegetables are convey'd, and seem to correspond to the veins, arteries
  and other Vessels in sensible creatures, that these pores I say, which
  seem to be the Vessels of nutrition to the vastest body in the World, are
  yet so exceeding small, that the <i>Atoms</i> which <i>Epicurus</i>
  fancy'd would go neer to prove too bigg to enter them, much more to
  constitute a fluid body in them. And how infinitely smaller then must be
  the Vessels of a Mite, or the pores of one of those little Vegetables I
  have discovered to grow on the back-side of a Rose-leaf, and shall anon
  more fully describe, whose bulk is many millions of times less then the
  bulk of the small shrub it grows on; and even that shrub, many millions
  of times less in bulk then several trees (that have heretofore grown in
  <i>England</i>, and are this day flourishing in other hotter Climates, as
  we are very credibly inform'd) if at least the pores of this small
  Vegetable should keep any such proportion to the body of it, as we have
  found these pores of other Vegetables to do to
  their bulk. But of these pores I have said more elsewhere.</p>

  <p>To proceed then, Cork seems to be by the transverse constitution of
  the pores, a kind of <i>Fungus</i> or Mushrome, for the pores lie like so
  many Rays tending from the center, or pith of the tree, outwards; so that
  if you cut off a piece from a board of Cork transversly, to the flat of
  it, you will, as it were, split the pores, and they will appear just as
  they are express'd in the Figure B of the XI. <i>Scheme</i>. But if you
  shave off a very thin piece from this board, parallel to the plain of it,
  you will cut all the pores transversly, and they will appear almost as
  they are express'd in the Figure A, save onely the solid
  <i>Interstitia</i> will not appear so thick as they are there
  represented.</p>

  <p>So that Cork seems to suck its nourishment from the subjacent bark of
  the Tree immediately, and to be a kind of excrescence, or a substance
  distinct from the substances of the entire Tree, something
  <i>analogus</i> to the Mushrome, or Moss on other Trees, or to the hairs
  on Animals. And having enquir'd into the History of Cork, I find it
  reckoned as an excrescency of the bark of a certain Tree, which is
  distinct from the two barks that lie within it, which are common also to
  other trees; That 'tis some time before the Cork that covers the young
  and tender sprouts comes to be discernable; That it cracks, flaws, and
  cleaves into many great chaps, the bark underneath remaining entire; That
  it may be separated and remov'd from the Tree, and yet the two
  under-barks (such as are also common to that with other Trees) not at all
  injur'd, but rather helped and freed from an external injury. Thus
  <i>Jonstonus</i> in <i>Dendrologia</i>, speaking <i>de Subere</i>, says,
  <i>Arbor est procera, Lignum est robustum, dempto cortice in aquis non
  fluitat, Cortice in orbem detracto juvatur, crascescens enim præstringit
  &amp; strangulat, intra triennium iterum repletur: Caudex ubi adolescit
  crassus, cortex superior densus carnosus, duos digitos crassus, scaber,
  rimosus, &amp; qui nisi detrahatur dehiscit, alioque subnascente
  expellitur, interior qui subest novellus ita rubet ut arbor minio picta
  videatur</i>. Which Histories, if well consider'd, and the tree,
  substance, and manner of growing, if well examin'd, would, I am very apt
  to believe, much confirm this my conjecture about the origination of
  Cork.</p>

  <p>Nor is this kind of Texture peculiar to Cork onely; for upon
  examination with my <i>Microscope</i>, I have found that the pith of an
  Elder, or almost any other Tree, the inner pulp or pith of the Cany
  hollow stalks of several other Vegetables: as of Fennel, Carrets, Daucus,
  Bur-docks, Teasels, Fearn, some kinds of Reeds, <i>&amp;c.</i> have much
  such a kind of <i>Schematisme</i>, as I have lately shewn that of Cork,
  save onely that here the pores are rang'd the long-ways, or the same ways
  with the length of the Cane, whereas in Cork they are transverse.</p>

  <p>The pith also that fills that part of the stalk of a Feather that is
  above the Quil, has much such a kind of texture, save onely that which
  way soever I set this light substance, the pores seem'd to be cut
  transversly; so that I ghess this pith which fills the Feather, not to
  consist of abundance of long pores separated with Diaphragms, as Cork
  does, but to be a kind of solid or hardned froth,
  or a <i>congeries</i> of very small bubbles consolidated in that form,
  into a pretty stiff as well as tough concrete, and that each Cavern,
  Bubble, or Cell, is distinctly separate from any of the rest, without any
  kind of hole in the encompassing films, so that I could no more blow
  through a piece of this kinde of substance, then I could through a piece
  of Cork, or the sound pith of an Elder.</p>

  <p>But though I could not with my <i>Microscope</i>, nor with my breath,
  nor any other way I have yet try'd, discover a passage out of one of
  those cavities into another, yet I cannot thence conclude, that therefore
  there are none such, by which the <i>Succus nutritius</i>, or appropriate
  juices of Vegetables, may pass through them; for, in several of those
  Vegetables, whil'st green, I have with my <i>Microscope</i>, plainly
  enough discover'd these Cells or Poles fill'd with juices, and by degrees
  sweating them out; as I have also observed in green Wood all those long
  <i>Microscopical</i> pores which appear in Charcoal perfectly empty of
  any thing but Air.</p>

  <p>Now, though I have with great diligence endeavoured to find whether
  there be any such thing in those <i>Microscopical</i> pores of Wood or
  Piths, as the <i>Valves</i> in the heart, veins, and other passages of
  Animals, that open and give passage to the contain'd fluid juices one
  way, and shut themselves, and impede the passage of such liquors back
  again, yet have I not hitherto been able to say any thing positive in it;
  though, me thinks, it seems very probable, that Nature has in these
  passages, as well as in those of Animal bodies, very many appropriated
  Instruments and contrivances, whereby to bring her designs and end to
  pass, which 'tis not improbable, but that some diligent Observer, if
  help'd with better <i>Microscopes</i>, may in time detect.</p>

  <p>And that this may be so, seems with great probability to be argued
  from the strange <i>Phænomena</i> of sensitive Plants, wherein Nature
  seems to perform several Animal actions with the same <i>Schematism</i>
  or <i>Orginization</i> that is common to all Vegetables, as may appear by
  some no less instructive then curious Observations that were made by
  divers Eminent Members of the <i>Royal Society</i> on some of these kind
  of Plants, whereof an account was delivered in to them by the most
  Ingenious and Excellent <i>Physician</i>, Doctor <i>Clark</i>, which,
  having that liberty granted me by that most Illustrious Society, I have
  hereunto adjoyn'd.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are four Plants, two of which are little shrub Plants, with a
  little short stock, about an Inch above the ground, from whence are
  spread several sticky branches, round, streight, and   smooth in the distances between the Sprouts, but just under the Sprouts
  there are two sharp thorny prickles, broad in the letting on, as in the
  Bramble, one just under the Sprout, the other on the opposite side of the
  branch.</p>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-11.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 11.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 2.
</span>
  <p>The distances betwixt the Sprouts are usually something more then an Inch,
  and many upon a Branch, according to its length, and they grew so, that
  if the lower Sprout be on the left side of the Branch, the next above is
  on the right, and so to the end, not sprouting by pairs.</p>

  <p>At the end of each Sprout are generally four sprigs, two at the
  Extremity, and one on each side, just under it. At the first sprouting of
  these from the Branch to the Sprig where the leaves grow, they are full
  of little short white hairs, which wear off as the leaves grow, and then
  they are smooth as the Branch.</p>

  <p>Upon each of these sprigs, are, for the most part, eleven pair of
  leaves, neatly set into the uppermost part of the little sprig, exactly
  one against another, as it were in little <i>articulations</i>, such as
  Anatomists call <i>Enarthrosis</i>, where the round head of a Bone is
  received into another fitted for its motion; and standing very fitly to
  shut themselves and touch, the pairs just above them closing somewhat
  upon them, as in the shut sprig; so is the little round <i>Pedunculus</i>
  of this leaf fitted into a little cavity of the sprig, visible to the eye
  in a sprig new pluck'd, or in a sprig withered on the Branch, from which
  the leaves easily fall by touching.</p>

  <p>The leaf being almost an oblong square, and set into the
  <i>Pedunculus</i>, at one of the lower corners, receiveth from that not
  onely a <i>Spine</i>, as I may call it, which, passing through the leaf,
  divides it so length-ways that the outer-side is broader then the inner
  next the sprig, but little <i>fibres</i> passing obliquely towards the
  opposite broader side, seem to make it here a little muscular, and fitted
  to move the whole leaf, which, together with the whole sprig, are set
  full with little short whitish hairs.</p>

  <p>One of these Plants, whose branch seem'd to be older and more grown
  then the other, onely the tender Sprouts of it, after the leaves are
  shut, fall and hang down; of the other, the whole branches fall to the
  ground, if the Sun shine very warm, upon the first taking off the Glass,
  which I therefore call the <i>humble Plant</i>.</p>

  <p>The other two, which do never fall, nor do any of their branches flagg
  and hang down, shut not their leaves, but upon somewhat a hard stroke;
  the stalks seem to grow up from a root, and appear more
  <i>herbaceous</i>, they are round and smooth, without any prickle, the
  Sprouts from them have several pairs of sprigs, with much less leaves
  then the other on them, and have on each sprig generally seventeen
  pair.</p>

  <p>Upon touching any of the sprigs with leaves on, all the leaves on that
  sprig contracting themselves by pairs, joyned their upper superficies
  close together.</p>

  <p>Upon the dropping a drop of <i>Aqua fortis</i> on the sprig betwixt
  the leaves, <i>ff</i> all the leaves above shut presently, those below by
  pairs successively after, and by the lower leaves of the other branches,
  <i>ll</i>, <i>kk</i>, &amp;c. and so every pair successively, with some
  little distance of time betwixt, to the top of each sprig, and so they
  continu'd shut all the time we were there. But I returning the next day,
  and several days since, found all the leaves dilated again on two of the
  sprigs; but from <i>ff</i>, where the <i>Aqua fortis</i> had dropped
  upwards, dead and withered; but those below on the same sprig, green, and
  closing upon the touch, and are so to this day, <i>August</i> 14.</p>

  <p>With a pair of Scissers, as suddenly as it could be done, one of the
  leaves <i>bb</i> was clipped off in the middle, upon which that pair, and
  the pair above, closed presently, after a little interval, <i>dd</i>,
  then <i>ee</i>, and so the rest of the pairs, to the bottom of the sprig,
  and then the motion began in the lower pairs, <i>ll</i>, on the other
  sprigs, and so shut them by pairs upwards, though not with such distinct
  distances.</p>

  <p>Under a pretty large branch with its sprigs on, there lying a large
  Shell betwixt two and three Inches below it, there was rubbed on a strong
  sented oyl, after a little time all the leaves on that sprig were shut,
  and so they continued all the time of our stay there, but at my returne
  the next day, I found the position of the Shell alter'd, and the leaves
  expanded as before, and closing upon the touch.</p>

  <p>Upon the application of the Sun-beams by a Burning-glass, the more
  <i>humble Plant</i> fell, the other shut their leaves.</p>

  <p>We could not so apply the smoak of <i>Sulpher</i>, as to have any
  visible effect from that, at two or three times trial; but on another
  trial, the smoak touching the leaves, it succeeded.</p>

  <p>The <i>humble Plant</i> fell upon taking off the Glass wherewith it
  was covered.</p>

  <p>Cutting off one of the little Sprouts, two or three drops of liquor
  were thrust out of the part from whence that was cut, very cleer, and
  pellucid, of a bright greenish colour, tasting at first a little
  bitterish, but after leaving a licorish-like taste in my mouth.</p>

  <p>Since, going two or three times when it was cold, I took the Glasses
  from the more <i>humble Plant</i>, and it did not fall as formerly, but
  shut its leaves onely. But coming afterwards, when the Sun shone very
  warm, as soon as it was taken off, it fell as before.</p>

  <p>Since I pluck'd off another sprig, whose leaves were all shut, and had
  been so some time, thinking to observe the liquor should come from that I
  had broken off, but finding none, though with pressing, to come, I, as
  dexterously as I could, pull'd off one whose leaves were expanded, and
  then had upon the shutting of the leaves, a little of the mention'd
  liquor, from the end of the sprig I had broken from the Plant. And this
  twice successively, as often almost as I durst rob the Plant.</p>

  <p>But my curiosity carrying me yet further, I cut off one of the harder
  branches of the stronger Plant, and there came of the
  liquor, both from that I had cut, and that I had cut it from, without
  pressure.</p>

  <p>Which made me think, that the motion of this Plant upon touching,
  might be from this, that there being a constant <i>intercourse</i>
  betwixt every part of this Plant and its root, either by a
  <i>circulation</i> of this liquor, or a constant pressing of the subtiler
  parts of it to every extremity of the Plant. Upon every pressure, from
  whatsoever it proceeds, greater then that which keeps it up, the subtile
  parts of this liquor are thrust downwards, towards its
  <i>articulations</i> of the leaves, where, not having room presently to
  get into the sprig, the little round <i>pedunculus</i>, from whence the
  <i>Spine</i> and those oblique <i>Fibres</i> I mentioned rise, being
  dilated, the <i>Spine</i> and <i>Fibres</i> (being continued from it)
  must be contracted and shortned, and so draw the leaf upwards to joyn
  with its fellow in the same condition with it self, where, being closed,
  they are held together by the implications of the little whitish hair, as
  well as by the still retreating liquor, which distending the
  <i>Fibres</i> that are continued lower to the branch and root, shorten
  them above; and when the liquor is so much forced from the Sprout, whose
  <i>Fibres</i> are yet tender, and not able to support themselves, but by
  that tensness which the liquor filling their <i>interstices</i> gives
  them, the Sprout hangs and flags.</p>

  <p>But, perhaps, he that had the ability and leisure to give you the
  exact <i>Anatomy</i> of this pretty Plant, to shew you its <i>Fibres</i>,
  and visible <i>Canales</i>, through which this fine liquor circulateth,
  or is moved, and had the faculty of better and more copiously expressing
  his Observations and conceptions, such a one would easily from the motion
  of this liquor, solve all the <i>Phænomena</i>, and would not fear to
  affirm, that it is no obscure sensation this Plant hath. But I have said
  too much, I humbly submit, and am ready to stand corrected.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I have not yet made so full and satisfactory Observations as I desire
  on this Plant, which seems to be a Subject that will afford abundance of
  information. But as farr as I have had
  opportunity to examine it, I have discovered with my <i>Microscope</i>
  very curious structures and contrivances; but designing much more
  accurate examinations and trials, both with my <i>Microscope</i>, and
  otherwise, as soon as the season will permit, I shall not till then add
  any thing of what I have already taken notice of; but as farr as I have
  yet observ'd, I judge the motion of it to proceed from causes very
  differing from those by which Gut-strings, or Lute-strings, the beard of
  a wilde <i>Oat</i>, or the beard of the Seeds of <i>Geranium</i>,
  <i>Mosscatum</i>, or <i>Musk-grass</i> and other kinds of
  <i>Cranes-bill</i>, move themselves. Of which I shall add more in the
  subsequent Observations on those bodies.</p>

  <p>I have for several years together, in the Moneths of <i>June</i>,
  <i>July</i>, <i>August</i>, and <i>September</i> (when any of the green
  leaves of <i>Roses</i> begin to dry and grow yellow) observ'd many of
  them, especially the leaves of the old shrubs of <i>Damask Roses</i>, all
  bespecked with yellow stains; and the undersides just against them, to
  have little yellow hillocks of a gummous substance, and several of them
  to have small black spots in the midst of those yellow ones, which, to
  the naked eye, appear'd no bigger then the point of a Pin, or the
  smallest black spot or tittle of Ink one is able to make with a very
  sharp pointed Pen.</p>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-12.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 12.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 2.
</span>
  <p>Examining these with a <i>Microscope,</i> I was able plainly to
  distinguish, up and down the surface, several small yellow knobs, of a
  kind of yellowish red gummy substance, out of which I perceiv'd there
  sprung multitudes of little cases or black bodies like Seed-cods, and
  those of them that were quite without the hillock of Gumm, disclos'd
  themselves to grow out of it with a small Straw-colour'd and transparent
  stem, the which seed and stem appear'd very like those of common Moss
  (which I elsewhere describe) but that they were abundantly less, many
  hundreds of them being not able to equalize one single seed Cod of
  Moss.</p>

  <p>I have often doubted whether they were the seed Cods of some little
  Plant, or some kind of small Buds, or the Eggs of some very small Insect,
  they appear'd of a dark brownish red, some almost quite black, and of a
  Figure much resembling the seed-cod of Moss, but their stalks on which
  they grew were of a very fine transparent substance, almost like the
  stalk of mould, but that they seem'd somewhat more yellow.</p>

  <p>That which makes me to suppose them to be Vegetables, is for that I
  perceiv'd many of those hillocks bare or destitute, as if those bodies
  lay yet conceal'd, as G. In others of them, they were just springing out
  of their gummy hillocks, which all seem'd to shoot directly outwards, as
  at A. In others, as at B, I found them just gotten out, with very little
  or no stalk, and the Cods of an indifferent cize; but in
  others, as C, I found them begin to have little short stalks, or stems;
  in others, as D, those stems were grown bigger, and larger; and in
  others, as at E, F, H, I, K, L, <i>&amp;c.</i> those stems and Cods were
  grown a great deal bigger, and the stalks were more bulky about the root,
  and very much taper'd towards the top, as at F and L is most visible.</p>

  <p>I did not find that any of them had any seed in them, or that any of
  them were hollow, but as they grew bigger and bigger, I found those heads
  or Cods begin to turn their tops towards their roots, in the same manner
  as I had observ'd that of Moss to do; so that in all likelihood, Nature
  did intend in that posture, what she does in the like seed-cods of
  greater bulk, that is, that the seed, when ripe, should be shaken out and
  dispersed at the end of it, as we find in Columbine Cods, and the
  like.</p>

  <p>The whole Oval OOOO in the second <i>Figure</i> of the 12.
  <i>Scheme</i> represents a small part of a Rose leaf, about the bigness
  of the little Oval in the hillock, C, marked with the Figure X. in which
  I have not particularly observ'd all the other forms of the surface of
  the Rose-leaf, as being little to my present purpose.</p>

  <p>Now, if these Cods have a seed in them so proportion'd to the Cod, as
  thole of <i>Pinks</i>, and <i>Carnations</i>, and <i>Columbines</i>, and
  the like, how unimaginably small must each of those seeds necessarily be,
  for the whole length of one of the largest of those Cods was not 1/500
  part of an Inch; some not above 1/1000, and therefore certainly, very
  many thousand of them would be unable to make a bulk that should be
  visible to the naked eye; and if each of these contain the Rudiments of a
  young Plant of the same kind, what must we say of the pores and
  constituent parts of that?</p>

  <p>The generation of this Plant seems in part, ascribable to a kind of
  <i>Mildew</i> or <i>Blight</i>, whereby the parts of the leaves grow
  scabby, or putrify'd, as it were, so as that the moisture breaks out in
  little scabs or spots, which, as I said before, look like little knobs of
  a red gummous substance.</p>

  <p>From this putrify'd scabb breaks out this little Vegetable; which may
  be somewhat like a <i>Mould</i> or <i>Moss</i>; and may have its
  <i>equivocal</i> generation much after the same manner as I have supposed
  <i>Moss</i> or <i>Mould</i> to have, and to be a more simple and
  uncompounded kind of vegetation, which is set a moving by the
  <i>putrifactive</i> and <i>fermentative</i> heat, joyn'd with that of the
  ambient aerial, when (by the putrifaction and decay of some other parts
  of the vegetable, that for a while staid its progress) it is unfetter'd
  and left at liberty to move in its former course, but by reason of its
  <i>regulators</i>, moves and acts after quite another manner then it did
  when a <i>coagent</i> in the more compounded <i>machine</i> of the more
  perfect Vegetable.</p>

  <p>And from this very same Principle, I imagine the <i>Misleto</i> of
  Oaks, Thorns, Appletrees, and other Trees, to have its original: It
  seldom or never growing on any of those Trees, till they begin to wax
  decrepid, and decay with age, and are pester'd with many other
  infirmities.</p>

  <p>Hither also may be referr'd those multitudes and varieties of
  <i>Mushroms</i>, such as that, call'd <i>Jews-ears</i>, all sorts of
  <i>gray</i> and <i>green</i> Mosses, &amp;c. which infest
  all kind of Trees, shrubs, and the like, especially when they come to any
  bigness. And this we see to be very much the method of Nature throughout
  its operations, <i>putrifactive Vegetables</i> very often producing a
  Vegetable of a much less compounded nature, and of a much inferiour
  tribe; and <i>putrefactive</i> animal substances degenerating into some
  kind of animal production of a much inferiour rank, and of a more simple
  nature.</p>

  <p>Thus we find the humours and substances of the body, upon
  <i>putrifaction</i>, to produce strange kinds of moving Vermine: <i>the
  putrifaction</i> of the slimes and juices of the Stomack and Guts,
  produce Worms almost like Earth-worms, the Wheals in childrens hands
  produce a little Worm, call'd a <i>Wheal-worm</i>: The bloud and milk,
  and other humours, produce other kinds of Worms, at least, if we may
  believe what is deliver'd to us by very famous Authors; though, I
  confess, I have not yet been able to discover such my self.</p>

  <p>And whereas it may seem strange that <i>Vinegar</i>, <i>Meal</i>,
  musty <i>Casks</i>, &amp;c. are observ'd to breed their differing kinds
  of Insects, or living creatures, whereas they being Vegetable substances,
  seem to be of an inferiour kind, and so unable to produce a creature more
  noble, or of a more compounded nature then they themselves are of, and so
  without some concurrent seminal principle, may be thought utterly unfit
  for such an operation; I must add, that we cannot presently positively
  say, there are no animal substances, either mediately, as by the soil or
  fatning of the Plant from whence they sprung, or more immediately, by the
  real mixture or composition of such substances, join'd with them; or
  perchance some kind of Insect, in such places where such kind of
  <i>putrifying</i> or <i>fermenting</i> bodies are, may, by a certain
  instinct of nature, eject some sort of seminal principle, which
  cooperating with various kinds of <i>putrifying</i> substances, may
  produce various kinds of Insects, or Animate bodies: For we find in most
  sorts of those lower degrees of Animate bodies, that the
  <i>putrifying</i> substances on which these Eggs, Seeds, or seminal
  principles are cast by the Insect, become, as it were, the
  <i>Matrices</i> or Wombs that conduce very much to their generation, and
  may perchance also to their variation and alteration, much after the same
  manner, as, by strange and unnatural copulations, several new kinds of
  Animals are produc'd, as <i>Mules</i>, and the like, which are usually
  call'd Monstrous, because a little unusual, though many of them have all
  their principal parts as perfectly shap'd and adapted for their peculiar
  uses, as any of the most perfect Animals. If therefore the
  <i>putrifying</i> body, on which any kind of seminal or vital principle
  chances to be cast, become somewhat more then meerly a nursing and
  fostering helper in the generation and production of any kind of Animate
  body, the more neer it approaches the true nature of a Womb, the more
  power will it have on the by-blow it incloses. But of this somewhat more
  in the description of the <i>Water-gnat</i>. Perhaps some more accurate
  Enquiries and Observations about these matters might bring the Question
  to some certainty, which would be of no small concern in Natural
  Philosophy.</p>

  <p>But that <i>putrifying</i> animal substances may produce animals of an
  inferior kind, I see not any so very great a
  difficulty, but that one may, without much absurdity, admit: For as there
  may be multitudes of contrivances that go to the making up of one
  compleat Animate body; so, That some of those <i>coadjutors</i>, in the
  perfect existence and life of it, may be vitiated, and the life of the
  whole destroyed, and yet several of the constituting contrivances remain
  intire, I cannot think it beyond imagination or possibility; no more then
  that a like accidental process, as I have elswhere hinted, may also be
  supposed to explicate the method of Nature in the <i>Metamorphosis</i> of
  Plants. And though the difference between a Plant and an Animal be very
  great, yet I have not hitherto met with any so <i>cogent</i> an Argument,
  as to make me positive in affirming these two to be altogether
  <i>Heterogeneous</i> and of quite differing kinds of Nature: And besides,
  as there are many <i>Zoophyts</i>, and sensitive Plants (divers of which
  I have seen, which are of a middle nature, and seem to be Natures
  transition from one degree to another, which may be observ'd in all her
  other passages, wherein she is very seldom observ'd to leap from one step
  to another) so have we, in some Authors, Instances of Plants turning into
  Animals, and Animals into Plants, and the like; and some other very
  strange (because unheeded) proceedings of Nature; something of which kind
  may be met with, in the description of the <i>Water-Gnat</i>, though it
  be not altogether so direct to the present purpose.</p>

  <p>But to refer this Discourse of Animals to their proper places, I shall
  add, that though one should suppose, or it should be prov'd by
  Observations; that several of these kinds of Plants are accidentally
  produc'd by a casual <i>purifaction</i>, I see not any great reason to
  question, but that, notwithstanding its own production was as 'twere
  casual, yet it may germinate and produce seed, and by it propagate its
  own, that is, a new Species. For we do not know, but that the Omnipotent
  and All-wise Creator might as directly design the structure of such a
  Vegetable, or such an Animal to be produc'd out of such or such a
  <i>putrifaction</i> or change of this or that body, towards the
  constitution or structure of which, he knew it necessary, or thought it
  fit to make it an ingredient; as that the digestion or moderate heating
  of an Egg, either by the Female, or the Sun, or the heat of the Fire, or
  the like, should produce this or that Bird; or that <i>Putrifactive</i>
  and warm steams should, out of the blowings, as they call them, that is,
  the Eggs of a Flie, produce a living Magot, and that, by degrees, be
  turn'd into an <i>Aurelia</i>, and that, by a longer and a proportion'd
  heat, be <i>transmuted</i> into a Fly. Nor need we therefore to suppose
  it the more imperfect in its kind, then the more compounded Vegetable or
  Animal of which it is a part; for he might as compleatly furnish it with
  all kinds of contrivances necessary for its own existence, and the
  propagation of its own Species, and yet make it a part of a more
  compounded body: as a Clock-maker might make a Set of Chimes to be a part
  of a Clock, and yet, when the watch part or striking part are taken away,
  and the hindrances of its motion remov'd, this chiming part may go as
  accurately, and strike its tune as exactly, as if it were still a part of
  the compounded <i>Automaton</i>. So, though the original cause, or
  seminal principle from which this minute
  Plant on Rose leaves did spring; were, before the corruption caus'd by
  the Mill-dew, a component part of the leaf on which it grew, and did
  serve as a <i>coagent</i> in the production and constitution of it, yet
  might it be so consummate, as to produce a seed which might have a power
  of propagating the same species: the works of the Creator seeming of such
  an excellency, that though they are unable to help to the perfecting of
  the more compounded existence of the greater Plant or Animal, they may
  have notwithstanding an ability of acting singly upon their own internal
  principle, so as to produce a Vegetable body, though of a less compounded
  nature, and to proceed so farr in the method of other Vegetables, as to
  bear flowers and seeds, which may be capabale of propagating the like. So
  that the little cases which appear to grow on the top of the slender
  stalks, may, for ought I know, though I should suppose them to spring
  from the perverting of the usual course of the parent Vegetable, contain
  a seed, which, being scatter'd on other leaves of the same Plant, may
  produce a Plant of much the same kind.</p>

  <p>Nor are Damask-Rose leaves the onely leaves that produce these kinds
  of Vegetable sproutings; for I have observ'd them also in several other
  kinds of Rose leaves, and on the leaves of several sorts of Briers, and
  on Bramble leaves they are oftentimes to be found in very great clusters;
  so that I have found in one cluster, three, four, or five hundred of

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXX" id="obsXX">XX</a>. <i>Of </i>blue Mould<i>, and of the first Principles of Vegetation
arising from </i>Putrefaction<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>The Blue and White and several kinds of hairy mouldy spots, which are
  observable upon divers kinds of <i>putrify'd</i> bodies, whether Animal
  substances, or Vegetable, such as the skin, raw or dress'd, flesh, bloud,
  humours, milk, green Cheese, <i>&amp;c.</i> or rotten sappy Wood, or
  Herbs, Leaves, Barks, Roots, <i>&amp;c.</i> of Plants, are all of them
  nothing else but several kinds of small and variously figur'd Mushroms,
  which, from convenient materials in those <i>putrifying</i> bodies, are,
  by the concurrent heat of the Air, excited to a certain kind of
  vegetation, which will not be unworthy our more serious speculation and
  examination, as I shall by and by shew. But, first, I must premise a
  short description of this <i>Specimen</i>, which I have added of this
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-12.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 12.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 1.
</span>
  Tribe, in the first Figure of the XII. <i>Scheme</i>, which is nothing
  else but the appearance of a small white spot of hairy mould, multitudes
  of which I found to bespeck &amp; whiten over the red covers of a small
  book, which, it seems, were of Sheeps skin, that being more apt to gather
  mould, even in a dry and clean room, then other leathers. These spots
  appear'd, through a good <i>Microscope</i>, to be a very pretty shap'd
  Vegetative body, which, from almost the same part of the Leather, shot
  out multitudes of small long cylindrical
  and transparent stalks, not exactly streight, but a little bended with
  the weight of a round and white knob that grew on the top of each of
  them; many of these knobs I observ'd to be very round, and of a smooth
  surface, such as A, A, <i>&amp;c.</i> others smooth likewise, but a little
  oblong, as B; several of them a little broken, or cloven with chops at
  the top, as C; others flitter'd as 'twere, or flown all to pieces, as D, D.
  The whole substance of these pretty bodies was of a very tender
  constitution, much like the substance of the softer kind of common white
  Mushroms, for by touching them with a Pin, I found them to be brused and
  torn; they seem'd each of them to have a distinct root of their own; for
  though they grew neer together in a cluster, yet I could perceive each
  stem to rise out of a distinct part or pore of the Leather; some of these
  were small and short, as seeming to have been but newly sprung up, of
  these the balls were for the most part round, others were bigger, and
  taller, as being perhaps of a longer growth, and of these, for the most
  part, the heads were broken, and some much wasted, as E; what these heads
  contain'd I could not perceive; whether they were knobs and flowers, or
  seed cases, I am not able to say, but they seem'd most likely to be of
  the same nature with those that grow on Mushroms, which they did, some of
  them, not a little resemble.</p>

  <p>Both their smell and taste, which are active enough to make a sensible
  impression upon those organs, are unpleasant and noisome.</p>

  <p>I could not find that they would so quickly be destroy'd by the actual
  flame of a Candle, as at first sight of them I conceived they would be,
  but they remain'd intire after I had past that part of the Leather on
  which they stuck three or four times through the flame of a Candle; so
  that, it seems they are not very apt to take fire, no more then the
  common white Mushroms are when they are sappy.</p>

  <p>There are a multitude of other shapes, of which these
  <i>Microscopical</i> Mushroms are figur'd, which would have been a long
  Work to have described, and would not have suited so well with my design
  in this Treatise, onely, amongst the rest, I must not forget to take
  notice of one that was a little like to, or resembled, a Spunge,
  consisting of a multitude of little Ramifications almost as that body
  does, which indeed seems to be a kind of Water-Mushrom, of a very pretty
  texture, as I else-where manifest. And a second, which I must not omit,
  because often mingled, and neer adjoining to these I have describ'd, and
  this appear'd much like a Thicket of bushes, or brambles, very much
  branch'd, and extended, some of them, to a great length, in proportion to
  their Diameter, like creeping brambles.</p>

  <p>The manner of the growth and formation of this kind of Vegetable, is
  the third head of Enquiry, which, had I time, I should follow: the figure
  and method of Generation in this concrete seeming to me, next after the
  Enquiry into the formation, figuration; or chrystalization of Salts, to
  be the most simple, plain, and easie; and it seems to be a <i>medium</i>
  through which he must necessarily pass, that would with any likelihood
  investigate the <i>forma informans</i> of Vegetables: for as I think that
  he shall find it a very difficult task, who undertakes to discover the
  form of Saline crystallizations, without the consideration
  and prescience of the nature and reason of a Globular form, and as
  difficult to explicate this configuration of Mushroms, without the
  previous consideration of the form of Salts; so will the enquiry into the
  forms of Vegetables be no less, if not much more difficult, without the
  fore-knowledge of the forms of Mushroms, these several Enquiries having
  no less dependance one upon another then any select number of
  Propositions in Mathematical Elements may be made to have.</p>

  <p>Nor do I imagine that the skips from the one to another will be found
  very great, if beginning from fluidity, or body without any form, we
  descend gradually, till we arrive at the highest form of a bruite
  Animal's Soul, making the steps or foundations of our Enquiry,
  <i>Fluidity</i>, <i>Orbiculation</i>, <i>Fixation</i>,
  <i>Angulization</i>, or <i>Crystallization Germination</i> or
  <i>Ebullition</i>, <i>Vegetation</i>, <i>Plantanimation</i>,
  <i>Animation</i>, <i>Sensation</i>, <i>Imagination</i>.</p>

  <p>Now, that we may the better proceed in our Enquiry, It will be
  requisite to consider:</p>

  <p>First, that Mould and Mushroms require no seminal property, but the
  former may be produc'd at any time from any kind of <i>putrifying</i>
  Animal, or Vegetable Substance, as Flesh, <i>&amp;c.</i> kept moist and
  warm, and the latter, if what <i>Mathiolus</i> relates be true, of making
  them by Art, are as much within our command, of which Matter take the
  <i>Epitomie</i> which Mr. <i>Parkinson</i> has deliver'd in his
  <i>Herbal</i>, in his Chapter of <i>Mushroms</i>, because I have not
  <i>Mathiolus</i> now by me: <i>Unto these Mushroms</i> (saith he) <i>may
  also be adjoyn'd those which are made of Art (whereof </i>Mathiolus<i>
  makes mention) that grow naturally among certain stones in </i>Naples<i>,
  and that the stones being digg'd up, and carried to </i>Rome<i>, and
  other places, where they set them in their Wine Cellars, covering them
  with a little Earth, and sprinkling a little warm water thereon, would
  within four days produce Mushroms fit to be eaten, at what time one will:
  As also that Mushroms may be made to grow at the foot of a wilde
  </i>Poplar Tree<i>, within four days after, warm water wherein some
  leaves have been dissolv'd shall be pour'd into the Root (which must be
  slit) and the stock above ground.</i></p>

  <p>Next, that as Mushroms may be generated without seed, so does it not
  appear that they have any such thing as seed in any part of them; for
  having considered several kinds of them, I could never find any thing in
  them that I could with any probability ghess to be the seed of it, so
  that it does not as yet appear (that I know of) that Mushroms may be
  generated from a seed, but they rather seem to depend merely upon a
  convenient constitution of the matter out of which they are made, and a
  concurrence of either natural or artificial heat.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, that by several bodies (as Salts and Metals both in Water and
  in the air, and by several kinds of sublimations in the Air) actuated and
  guided with a congruous heat, there may be produc'd several kinds of
  bodies as curiously, if not of a more compos'd Figure; several kinds of
  rising or Ebulliating Figures seem to manifest; as witness the shooting
  in the Rectification of spirits of <i>Urine</i>, <i>Hart-horn</i>,
  <i>Bloud</i>, &amp;c. witness also the curious branches of evaporated
  dissolutions, some of them against the sides
  of the containing Jar: others standing up, or growing an end, out of the
  bottom, of which I have taken notice of a very great variety. But above
  all the rest, it is a very pretty kind of Germination which is afforded
  us in the Silver Tree, the manner of making which with Mercury and
  Silver, is well known to the Chymists, in which there is an Ebullition or
  Germination, very much like this of Mushroms, if I have been rightly
  inform'd of it.</p>

  <p>Fourthly, I have very often taken notice of, and also observ'd with a
  <i>Microscope</i>, certain excrescencies or Ebullitions in the snuff of a
  Candle, which, partly from the sticking of the smoaky particles as they
  are carryed upwards by the current of the rarify'd Air and flame, and
  partly also from a kind of Germination or Ebullition of some actuated
  unctuous parts which creep along and filter through some small string of
  the Week, are formed into pretty round and uniform heads, very much
  resembling the form of hooded Mushroms, which, being by any means expos'd
  to the fresh Air, or that air which encompasses the flame, they are
  presently lick'd up and devour'd by it, and vanish.</p>

  <p>The reason of which <i>Phænomenon</i> seems to me, to be no other then
  this:</p>

  <p>That when a convenient thread of the Week is so bent out by the sides
  of the snuff that are about half an Inch or more, remov'd above the
  bottom, or lowest part of the flame, and that this part be wholly
  included in the flame; the Oyl (for the reason of filtration, which I
  have elsewhere rendred) being continualy driven up the snuff is driven
  likewise into this ragged bended-end, and this being remov'd a good
  distance, as half an Inch or more, above the bottom of the flame, the
  parts of the air that passes by it, are already, almost satiated with the
  dissolution of the boiling unctuous steams that issued out below, and
  therefore are not onely glutted, that is, can dissolve no more then what
  they are already acting upon, but they carry up with them abundance of
  unctuous and sooty particles, which meeting with that rag of the Week,
  that is plentifully fill'd with Oyl, and onely spends it as fast as it
  evaporates, and not at all by dissolution or burning, by means of these
  steamy parts of the filterated Oyl issuing out at the sides of this ragg,
  and being inclos'd with an air that is already satiated and cannot prey
  upon them nor burn them, the ascending sooty particles are stay'd about
  it and fix'd, so as that about the end of that ragg or filament of the
  snuff, whence the greatest part of the steams issue, there is conglobated
  or fix'd a round and pretty uniform cap, much resembling the head of a
  Mushrom, which, if it be of any great bigness, you may observe that its
  underside will be bigger then that which is above the ragg or stem of it;
  for the Oyl that is brought into it by filtration, being by the bulk of
  the cap a little shelter'd from the heat of the flame, does by that means
  issue as much out beneath from the stalk or downwards, as it does
  upwards, and by reason of the great access of the adventitious smoak from
  beneath, it increases most that way. That this may be the true reason of
  this <i>Phænomenon</i>, I could produce many Arguments and Experiments to
  make it probable: As,</p>

  <p>First, that the <i>Filtration</i> carries the Oyl to the top of the
  Week, at least as high as these raggs, is visible to one
  that will observe the snuff of a burning Candle with a <i>Microscope</i>,
  where he may see an Ebullition or bubbling of the Oyl, as high as the
  snuff looks black.</p>

  <p>Next, that it does steam away more then burn; I could tell you of the
  dim burning of a Candle, the longer the snuff be which arises from the
  abundance of vapours out of the higher parts of it.</p>

  <p>And, thirdly, that in the middle of the flame of the Candle, neer the
  top of the snuff, the fire or dissolving principle is nothing neer so
  strong, as neer the bottom and out edges of the flame, which may be
  observ'd by the burning asunder of a thread, that will first break in
  those parts that the edges of the flame touch, and not in the middle.</p>

  <p>And I could add several Observables that I have taken notice of in the
  flame of a Lamp actuated with Bellows, and very many others that confirm
  me in my opinion, but that it is not so much to my present purpose, which
  is onely to consider this concreet in the snuff of a Candle, so farr as
  it has any resemblance of a Mushrom, to the consideration of which, that
  I may return, I say, we may also observe:</p>

  <p>In the fifth place, that the droppings or trillings of Lapidescent
  waters in Vaults under ground, seem to constitute a kind of
  <i>petrify'd</i> body, form'd almost like some kind of Mushroms inverted,
  in so much that I have seen some knobb'd a little at the lower end,
  though for the most part, indeed they are otherwise shap'd, and taper'd
  towards the end; the generation of which seems to be from no other reason
  but this, that the water by soaking through the earth and Lime (for I
  ghess that substance to add much to it <i>petrifying</i> quality) does so
  impregnate it self with stony particles, that hanging in drops in the
  roof of the Vault, by reason that the soaking of the water is but slow,
  it becomes expos'd to the Air, and thereby the outward part of the drop
  by degrees grows hard, by reason that the water gradually evaporating the
  stony particles neer the outsides of the drop begin to touch, and by
  degrees, to dry and grow closer together, and at length constitute a
  crust or shell about the drop; and this soaking by degrees, being more
  and more supply'd, the drop grows longer and longer, and the sides harden
  thicker and thicker into a Quill or Cane, and at length, that hollow or
  pith becomes almost stop'd up, and solid: afterwards the soaking of the
  <i>petrifying</i> water, finding no longer a passage through the middle,
  bursts out, and trickles down the outside, and as the water evaporates,
  leaves new superinduc'd shells, which more and more swell the bulk of
  those Iceicles, and because of the great supply from the Vault, of
  <i>petrifying</i> wafer, those bodies grow bigger and bigger next to the
  Vault, and taper or sharpen towards the point; for the access from the
  arch of the Vault being but very slow, and consequently the water being
  spread very thinly over the surface of the Iceicle, the water begins to
  settle before it can reach to the bottom, or corner end of it; whence, if
  you break one of these, you would almost imagine it a stick of Wood
  <i>petrify'd</i>, it having so pretty a resemblance of pith and grain,
  and if you look on the outside of a piece, or of one whole, you would
  think no less, both from its vegetable roundness and
  tapering form; but whereas all Vegetables are observ'd to shoot and grow
  perpendicularly upwards, this does shoot or propend directly
  downwards.</p>

  <p>By which last Observables, we see that there may be a very pretty body
  shap'd and concreeted by Mechanical principles, without the least shew or
  probability of any other seminal <i>formatrix</i>.</p>

  <p>And since we find that the great reason of the <i>Phænomena</i> of
  this pretty <i>petrifaction</i>, are to be reduc'd from the gravity of a
  fluid and pretty volatil body impregnated with stony particles, why may
  not the <i>Phænomena</i> of Ebullition or Germination be in part possibly
  enough deduc'd from the levity of an impregnated liquor, which therefore
  perpendicularly ascending by degrees, evaporates and leaves the more
  solid and fix'd parts behind in the form of a Mushrom, which is yet
  further diversify'd and specificated by the forms of the parts that
  impregnated the liquor, and compose or help to constitute the
  Mushrom.</p>

  <p>That the foremention'd Figures of growing Salts, and the Silver Tree,
  are from this principle, I could very easily manifest, but that I have
  not now a convenient opportunity of following it, nor have I made a
  sufficient number of Experiments and Observations to propound, explicate,
  and prove so usefull a <i>Theory</i> as this of Mushroms: for, though the
  contrary principle to that of <i>petrify'd</i> Iceicles may be in part a
  cause, yet I cannot but think, that there is somewhat a more complicated
  caufe, though yet Mechanical, and possible to be explain'd.</p>

  <p>We therefore have further to enquire of it, what makes it to be such a
  liquor, and to ascend, whether the heat of the Sun and Air, or whether
  that <i>firmentiation</i> and <i>putrifaction</i>, or both together; as
  also whether there be not a third or fourth; whether a Saline principle
  be not a considerable agent in this business also as well as heat;
  whether also a fixation, precipitation or settling of certain parts out
  of the aerial menstruum may not be also a considerable coadjutor in the
  business. Since we find that many pretty beards <i>stiriæ</i> of the
  particles of Silver may be precipitated upon a piece of Brass put into a
  <i>solution</i> of Silver very much diluted with fair water, which look
  not unlike a kind of mould or hoar upon that piece of metal; and the hoar
  frost looks like a kind of mould; and whether there may not be several
  others that do concurr to the production of a Mushrom, having not yet had
  sufficient time to prosecute according to my desires, I must referr this
  to a better opportunity of my own, or leave and recommend it to the more
  diligent enquiry and examination of such as can be masters both of
  leisure and conveniencies for such an Enquiry.</p>

  <p>And in the mean time, I must conclude, that as far as I have been able
  to look into the nature of this Primary kind of life and vegetation, I
  cannot find the least probable argument to perswade me there is any other
  concurrent cause then such as is purely Mechanical, and that the effects
  or productions are as necessary upon the concurrence of those causes as
  that a Ship, when the Sails are hoist up, and the Rudder is set to such a
  position, should, when the Wind blows, be mov'd in such a way or course
  to that or t'other place; Or, as that the
  brused Watch, which I mention in the description of Moss, should, when
  those parts which hindred its motion were fallen away, begin to move, but
  after quite another manner then it did before.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXXI" id="obsXXI">XXI</a>. <i>Of </i>Moss<i>, and several other small-vegetative Substances.</i></h3>

  <p>Moss is a Plant, that the wisest of Kings thought neither unworthy his
  speculation, nor his Pen, and though amongst Plants it be in bulk one of
  the smallest, yet it is not the least considerable: For, as to its shape,
  it may compare for the beauty of it with any Plant that grows, and bears
  a much bigger breadth; it has a root almost like a seedy Parsnep,
  furnish'd with small strings and suckers, which are all of them finely
  branch'd, like those of the roots of much bigger Vegetables; out of this
  springs the stem or body of the Plant, which is somewhat
  <i>Quadrangular</i>, rather then <i>Cylindrical</i>, most curiously
  <i>fluted</i> or lining with small creases, which run, for the most part,
  <i>parallel</i> the whole stem; on the sides of this are close and thick
  set, a multitude of fair, large, well-shap'd leaves, some of them of a
  rounder, others of a longer shape, according as they are younger or older
  when pluck'd; as I ghess by this, that those Plants that had the stalks
  growing from the top of them, had their leaves of a much longer shape,
  all the surface of each side of which, is curiously cover'd with a
  multitude of little oblong transparent bodies, in the manner as you see
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-13.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 13.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> B.
</span>
  it express'd in the leaf B, in the XIII. <i>Scheme</i>.</p>

  <p>This Plant, when young and springing up, does much resemble a
  Housleek, having thick leaves, almost like that, and seems to be somwhat
  of kin to it in other particulars; also from the top of the leaves, there
  shoots out a small white and transparent hair, or thorn: This stem, in
  time, come to shoot out into a long, round and even stalk, which by
  cutting transversly, when dry, I manifestly found to be a stiff, hard,
  and hollow Cane, or Reed, without any kind of knot, or stop, from its
  bottom, where the leaves encompass'd it, to the top, on which there grows
  a large seed case, A, cover'd with a thin, and more whitish skin, B,
  terminated in a long thorny top, which at first covers all the Case, and
  by degrees, as that swells, the skin cleaves, and at length falls off,
  with its thorny top and all (which is a part of it) and leaves the seed
  Case to ripen, and by degrees, to shatter out its seed at a place
  underneath this cap, B, which before the seed is ripe, appears like a
  flat barr'd button, without any hole in the middle; but as it ripens, the
  button grows bigger, and a hole appears in the middle of it, E, out of
  which, in all probability, the seed falls: For as it ripens by a
  provision of Nature, that end of this Case turns downward after the same
  manner as the ears of Wheat and Barley usually do; and opening several of
  these dry red Cases, F, I found them to be quite
  hollow, without anything at all in them; whereas when I cut them asunder
  with a sharp Pen-knife when green, I found in the middle of this great
  Case, another smaller round Case, between which two, the
  <i>interstices</i> were fill'd with multitudes of stringie <i>fibres</i>,
  which seem'd to suspend the lesser Case in the middle of the other, which
  (as farr as I was able to discern) seem'd full of exceeding small white
  seeds, much like the seed-bagg in the knop of a Carnation, after the
  flowers have been two or three days, or a week, fallen off; but this I
  could not so perfectly discern, and therefore cannot positively affirm
  it.</p>

  <p>After the seed was fallen away, I found both the Case, Stalk, and
  Plant, all grow red and wither, and from other parts of the root
  continually to spring new branches or slips, which by degrees increased,
  and grew as bigg as the former, seeded, ripen'd, shatter'd, and
  wither'd.</p>

  <p>I could not find that it observ'd any particular seasons for these
  several kinds of growth, but rather found it to be springing, mature,
  ripe, seedy, and wither'd at all times of the year; But I found it most
  to flourish and increase in warm and moist weather.</p>

  <p>It gathers its nourishments, for the most part, out of some
  <i>Lapidescent</i>, or other substance corrupted or chang'd from its
  former texture, or substantial form; for I have found it to grow on the
  rotten parts of Stone, of Bricks, of Wood, of Bones, of Leather,
  <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>It oft grows on the barks of several Trees, spreading it self,
  sometimes from the ground upwards, and sometimes from some chink or cleft
  of the bark of the Tree, which has some <i>putrify'd</i> substance in it,
  but this seems of a distinct kind from that which I observ'd to grow on
  <i>putrify'd</i> inanimate bodies, and rotten earth.</p>

  <p>There are also great varieties of other kinds of Mosses, which grow on
  Trees, and several other Plants, of which I shall here make no mention,
  nor of the Moss growing on the skull of a dead man, which much resembles
  that of Trees.</p>

  <p>Whether this Plant does sometimes originally spring or rise out of
  corruption, without any disseminated seed, I have not yet made trials
  enough to be very much, either positive or negative; for as it seems very
  hard to conceive how the seed should be generally dispers'd into all
  parts where there is a corruption begun, unless we may rationally
  suppose, that this seed being so exceeding small, and consequently
  exceeding light, is thereby taken up, and carried to and fro in the Air
  into every place, and by the falling drops of rain is wash'd down out of
  it, and so dispers'd into all places, and there onely takes root and
  propagates, where it finds a convenient soil or matrix for it to thrive
  in; so if we will have it to proceed from corruption, it is not less
  difficult to conceive,</p>

  <p>First, how the corruption of any Vegetable, much less of any Stone or
  Brick, should be the Parent of so curiously figur'd, and so perfect a
  Plant as this is. But here indeed, I cannot but add, that it seems rather
  to be a product of the Rain in those bodies where it is stay'd, then of
  the very bodies themselves, since I have found it growing on Marble, and
  Flint, but always the <i>Microscope</i>, if not the naked eye, would
  discover some little hole of Dirt in which it was rooted.</p>

  <p>Next, how the corruption of each of those exceedingly differing bodies
  should all conspire to the production of the same Plant, that is, that
  Stones, Bricks, Wood, or vegetable substances, and Bones, Leather, Horns,
  or animate substances, unless we may with some plausibleness say, that
  Air and Water are the coadjutors, or <i>menstruums</i>, all kinds of
  <i>putrifactions</i>, and that thereby the bodies (though whil'st they
  retain'd their substantial forms, were of exceeding differing natures,
  yet) since they are dissolv'd and mixt into another, they may be very
  <i>Homogeneous</i>, they being almost resolv'd again into Air, Water, and
  Earth; retaining, perhaps, one part of their vegetative faculty yet
  entire, which meeting with congruous assistants, such as the heat of the
  Air, and the fluidity of the Water, and such like coadjutors and
  conveniences, acquires a certain vegetation for a time, wholly differing
  perhaps from that kind of vegetation it had before.</p>

  <p>To explain my meaning a little better by a gross Similitude:</p>

  <p>Suppose a curious piece of Clock-work, that had had several motions
  and contrivances in it, which, when in order, would all have mov'd in
  their design'd methods and Periods. We will further suppose, by some
  means, that this Clock comes to be broken, brused, or otherwise
  disordered, so that several parts of it being dislocated, are impeded,
  and so stand still, and not onely hinder its own progressive motion, and
  produce not the effect which they were design'd for, but because the
  other parts also have a dependence upon them, put a stop to their motion
  likewise; and so the whole Instrument becomes unserviceable,, and not fit
  for any use. This Instrument afterwards, by some shaking and tumbling,
  and throwing up and down, comes to have several of its parts shaken out,
  and several of its curious motions, and contrivances, and particles all
  fallen asunder; here a Pin falls out, and there a Pillar, and here a
  Wheel, and there a Hammer, and a Spring, and the like, and among the
  rest, away falls those parts also which were brused and disorder'd, and
  had all this while impeded the motion of all the rest; hereupon several
  of those other motions that yet remain, whole springs were not quite run
  down, being now at liberty, begin each of them to move, thus or thus, but
  quite after another method then before, there being many regulating parts
  and the like, fallen away and lost. Upon this, the Owner, who chances to
  hear and observe some of these effects, being ignorant of the
  Watch-makers Art, wonders what is betid his Clock, and presently imagines
  that some Artist has been at work, and has set his Clock in order, and
  made a new kind of Instrument of it, but upon examining circumstances, he
  finds there was no such matter, but that the casual slipping out of a Pin
  had made several parts of his Clock fall to pieces, and that thereby the
  obstacle that all this while hindred his Clock, together with other
  usefull parts were fallen out, and so his Clock was set at liberty. And
  upon winding up those springs again when run down, he finds his Clock to
  go, but quite after another manner then it was wont heretofore.</p>

  <p>And thus may it be perhaps in the business of Moss, and Mould, and
  Mushroms, and several other spontaneous kinds of vegetations, which
  may be caus'd by a vegetative principle,
  which was a coadjutor to the life and growth of the greater Vegetable,
  and was by the destroying of the life of it stopt and impeded in
  performing its office; but afterwards, upon a further corruption of
  several parts that had all the while impeded it, the heat of the Sun
  winding up, as it were, the spring, sets it again into a vegetative
  motion, and this being single, and not at all regulated as it was before
  (when a part of that greater <i>machine</i> the pristine vegetable) is
  mov'd after quite a differing manner, and produces effects very differing
  from those it did before.</p>

  <p>But this I propound onely as a conjecture, not that I am more enclin'd
  to this <i>Hypothesis</i> then the seminal, which upon good reason I
  ghess to be Mechanical also, as I may elsewhere more fully shew: But
  because I may, by this, hint a possible way how this appearance may be
  solv'd; supposing we should be driven to confess from certain Experiments
  and Observations made, that such or such Vegetables were produc'd out of
  the corruption of another, without any concurrent seminal principle (as I
  have given some reason to suppose, in the description of a
  <i>Microscopical</i> Mushrome) without derogating at all from the
  infinite wisdom of the Creator. For this accidental production, as I may
  call it, does manifest as much, if not very much more, of the excellency
  of his contrivance as any thing in the more perfect vegetative bodies of
  the world, even as the accidental motion of the <i>Automaton</i> does
  make the owner see, that there was much more contrivance in it then at
  first he imagin'd. But of this I have added more in the description of
  Mould, and the Vegetables on Rose leaves, <i>&amp;c.</i> those being much
  more likely to have their original from such a cause then this which I
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-13.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 13.</a>.
</span>
  have here described, in the 13. <i>Scheme</i>, which indeed I cannot
  conceive otherwise of, then as of a most perfect Vegetable, wanting
  nothing of the perfections of the most conspicuous and vastest Vegetables
  of the world, and to be of a rank so high, as that it may very properly
  be reckon'd with the tall Cedar of <i>Lebanon</i>, as that Kingly
  Botanist has done.</p>

  <p>We know there may be as much curiosity of contrivance, and excellency
  of form in a very small Pocket-clock, that takes not up an Inch square of
  room, as there may be in a Church-clock that fills a whole room; And I
  know not whether all the contrivances and <i>Mechanisms</i> requisite to
  a perfect Vegetable, may not be crowded into an exceedingly less room
  then this of Moss, as I have heard of a striking Watch so small, that it
  serv'd for a Pendant in a Ladies ear; and I have already given you the
  description of a Plant growing on Rose leaves, that is abundantly smaller
  then Moss; insomuch, that neer 1000. of them would hardly make the
  bigness of one single Plant of Moss. And by comparing the bulk of Moss,
  with the bulk of the biggest kind of Vegetable we meet with in Story (of
  which kind we find in some hotter climates, as <i>Guine</i>, and
  <i>Brasile</i>, the stock or body of some Trees to be twenty foot in
  Diameter, whereas the body or stem of Moss, for the most part, is not
  above one sixtieth part of an Inch) we shall find that the bulk of the
  one will exceed the bulk of the other, no less then 2985984 Millions,
  or 2985984000000, and supposing the
  production on a Rose leaf to be a Plant, we shall have of those
  <i>Indian</i> Plants to exceed a production of the same Vegetable kingdom
  no less then 1000 times the former number; so prodigiously various are
  the works of the Creator, and so All-sufficient is he to perform what to
  man would seem unpossible, they being both alike easie to him, even as
  one day, and a thousand years are to him as one and the same time.</p>

  <p>I have taken notice of such an infinite variety of those smaller kinds
  of vegetations, that should I have described every one of them, they
  would almost have fill'd a Volume, and prov'd bigg enough to have made a
  new Herbal, such multitudes are there to be found in moist hot weather,
  especially in the Summer time, on all kind of putrifying substances,
  which, whether they do more properly belong to the <i>Classis</i> of
  <i>Mushrooms</i>, or <i>Moulds</i>, or <i>Mosses</i>, I shall not now
  dispute, there being some that seem more properly of one kind, others of
  another, their colours and magnitudes being as much differing as their
  Figures and substances.</p>

  <p>Nay, I have observ'd, that putting fair Water (whether Rain-water or
  Pump-water, or <i>May-dew</i> or Snow-water, it was almost all one) I
  have often observ'd, I say, that this Water would, with a little
  standing, tarnish and cover all about the sides of the Glass that lay
  under water, with a lovely green; but though I have often endeavour'd to
  discover with my <i>Microscope</i> whether this green were like Moss, or
  long striped Sea-weed, or any other peculiar form, yet so ill and
  imperfect are our <i>Microscopes</i>, that I could not certainly
  discriminate any.</p>

  <p>Growing Trees also, and any kinds of Woods, Stones, Bones,
  <i>&amp;c.</i> that have been long expos'd to the Air and Rain, will be
  all over cover'd with a greenish scurff, which will very much foul and
  green any kind of cloaths that are rubb'd against it; viewing this, I
  could not certainly perceive in many parts of it any determinate form,
  though in many I could perceive a Bed as 'twere of young Moss, but in
  other parts it look'd almost like green bushes, and very confus'd, but
  always of what ever irregular Figures the parts appear'd of, they were
  always green, and seem'd to be either some Vegetable, or to have some
  vegetating principle.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXXII" id="obsXXII">XXII</a>. <i>Of common </i>Sponges<i>, and several other </i>Spongie<i>
fibrous bodies.</i></h3>

  <p>A Sponge is commonly reckon'd among the <i>Zoophyts</i>, or Plant
  Animals; and the <i>texture</i> of it, which the <i>Microscope</i>
  discovers, seems to confirm it; for it is of a form whereof I never
  observ'd any other Vegetable, and indeed, it seems impossible that any
  should be of it, for it consists of an infinite number of small short
  <i>fibres</i>, or nervous parts, much of the same bigness, curiously
  jointed or contex'd together in the form of a Net, as is more plainly
  manifest by the little Draught which I have added, in
  the third <i>Figure</i> of the IX. <i>Scheme</i>, of a piece of it, which
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-09.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 9.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 3.
</span>
  you may perceive represents a confus'd heap of the fibrous parts
  curiously jointed and implicated. The joints are, for the most part,
  where three <i>fibres</i> onely meet, for I have very seldom met with any
  that had four.</p>

  <p>At these joints there is no one of the three that seems to be the
  stock whereon the other grow, but each of the <i>fibres</i> are, for the
  most part, of an equal bigness, and seem each of them to have an equal
  share in the joint; the <i>fibres</i> are all of them much about the same
  bigness, not smaller towards the top of the Sponge, and bigger neerer the
  bottom or root, as is usuall in Plants, the length of each between the
  joints, is very irregular and different; the distance between some two
  joints, being ten or twelve times more then between some others.</p>

  <p>Nor are the joints regular, and of an <i>equitriagonal Figure</i>,
  but, for the most part, the three <i>fibres</i> so meet, that they
  compose three angles very differing all of them from one another.</p>

  <p>The meshes likewise, and holes of this reticulated body, are not less
  various and irregular: some <i>bilateral</i>, others <i>trilateral</i>,
  and <i>quadrilateral</i> Figures; nay, I have observ'd some meshes to
  have 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. sides, and some to have onely one, so exceeding
  various is the <i>Lusus Naturæ</i> in this body.</p>

  <p>As to the outward appearance of this Vegetative body, they are so
  usuall everywhere, that I need not describe them, consisting of a soft
  and porous substance, representing a Lock, sometimes a fleece of Wooll;
  but it has besides these small <i>microscopical</i> pores which lie
  between the <i>fibres</i>, a multitude of round pores or holes, which,
  from the top of it, pierce into the body, and sometimes go quite through
  to the bottom.</p>

  <p>I have observ'd many of these Sponges, to have included likewise in
  the midst of their fibrous contextures, pretty large friable stones,
  which must either have been inclos'd whil'st this Vegetable was in
  formation, or generated in those places after it was perfectly shap'd.
  The later of which seems the more improbable, because I did not find that
  any of these stony substances were perforated with the <i>fibres</i> of
  the Sponge.</p>

  <p>I have never seen nor been enform'd of the true manner of the growing
  of Sponges on the Rock; whether they are found to increase from little to
  great, like Vegetables, that is, part after part, or like Animals, all
  parts equally growing together; or whether they be <i>matrices</i> or
  feed-baggs of any kind of Fishes, or some kind of watry Insect; or
  whether they are at any times more soft and tender, or of another nature
  and texture, which things, if I knew how, I should much desire to be
  informed of: but from a cursory view that I at first made with my
  <i>Microscope</i>, and some other trials, I supposed it to be some Animal
  substance cast out, and fastned upon the Rocks in the form of a froth, or
  <i>congeries</i> of bubbles, like that which I have often observ'd on
  Rosemary, and other Plants (wherein is included a little Insect) that all
  the little films which divide these bubbles one from another, did
  presently, almost after the substance began to grow a little harder,
  break, and leave onely the thread behind, which might be, as 'twere, the
  angle or thread between the bubbles, that the great
  holes or pores observable in these Sponges were made by the eruption of
  the included <i>Heterogeneous</i> substance (whether air, or some other
  body, for many other fluid bodies will do the same thing) which breaking
  out of the lesser, were collected into very large bubbles, and so might
  make their way out of the Sponge, and in their passage might leave a
  round cavity; and if it were large, might carry up with it the adjacent
  bubbles, which may be perceiv'd at the outside of the Sponge, if it be
  first throughly wetted, and sufferr'd to plump itself into its natural
  form, or be then wrung dry, and suffer'd to expand it self again, which
  it will freely do whil'st moist: for when it has thus plump'd it self
  into its natural shape and dimensions, 'tis obvious enough that the
  mouths of the larger holes have a kind of lip or rising round about them,
  but the other smaller pores have little or none. It may further be found,
  that each of these great pores has many other small pores below, that are
  united unto it, and help to constitute it, almost like so many rivulets
  or small streams that contribute to the maintenance of a large River. Nor
  from this <i>Hypothesis</i> would it have been difficult to explicate,
  how those little branches of <i>Coral</i>, smal <i>Stones</i>,
  <i>shells</i>, and the like, come to be included by these frothy bodies:
  But this inded was but a conjecture; and upon a more accurate enquiry
  into the form of it with the <i>Microscope</i>, it seems not to be the
  true origine of them; for whereas Sponges have onely three arms which
  join together at each knot, if they had been generated from bubbles they
  must have had four.</p>

  <p>But that they are Animal Substances, the <i>Chymical</i> examination
  of them seems to manifest, they affording a volatil Salt and spirit, like
  <i>Harts-Horn</i>, as does also their great strength and toughness, and
  their smell when burn'd in the Fire or a Candle, which has a kind of
  fleshy sent, not much unlike to hair. And having since examin'd several
  Authors concerning them, among others; I find this account given by
  <i>Bellonius</i>, in the XI. <i>Chap.</i> of his 2<sup>d</sup> Book,
  <i>De Aquatilibus</i>. <i>Spongiæ recentes</i>, says he, <i>à siccis
  longe diversæ, scopulis aquæ marinæ ad duos vel tres cubitos, nonnunquam
  quatuor tantum digitos immersis, ut fungi arboribus adhærent, sordido
  quodam succo aut mucosa potius sanie refertæ, usque adeò f&#339;tida, ut
  vel eminus nauseam excitet, continetur autem iis cavernis, quas inanes in
  siccis &amp; lotis Spongiis cernimus: Putris pulmonis modo nigræ
  conspiciuntur, verùm quæ in sublimi aquæ nascuntur multo magis opaca
  nigredine suffusæ sunt. Vivere quidem Spongias adhærendo
  </i>Aristoteles<i> censet: absolute vero minime: sensumque aliquem
  habere, vel eo argumento (inquit) credantur, quod difficillime
  abstrahantur, nisi clanculum agatur: Atq; ad avulsoris accessum ita
  contrahantur, ut eas evellere difficile sit, quod idem etiam faciunt
  quoties flatus tempestatésque urgent. Puto autem illis succum sordidum
  quem supra diximus carnis loco à natura attributum fuisse: atque meatibus
  latioribus tanquam intestinis aut interaneis uti. Cæterum pars ea quæ
  Spongiæ cautibus adhærent est tanquam folii petiolus, à quo veluti collum
  quoddam gracile incipit: quod deinde in latitudinem diffusum capitis
  globum facit. Recentibus nihil est fistulosum, hæsitantque tanquam
  radicibus. Superne omnes propemodum meatus concreti latent: inferne verò
  quaterni aut quini patent, per quos eas
  sugere existimamus</i>. From which Description, they seem to be a kind of
  Plant-Animal that adheres to a Rock, and these small <i>fibres</i> or
  threads which we have described, seem to have been the Vessels which
  ('tis very probable) were very much bigger whil'st the <i>Interstitia</i>
  were fill'd (as he affirms) with a mucous, pulpy or fleshy substance; but
  upon the drying were shrunk into the bigness they now appear.</p>

  <p>The texture of it is such, that I have not yet met with any other body
  in the world that has the like, but onely one of a larger sort of Sponge
  (which is preserv'd in the <i>Museum Harveanum</i> belonging to the most
  Illustrious and most learned Society of the <i>Physicians</i> of
  <i>London</i>) which is of a horney, or rather of a <i>petrify'd</i>
  substance. And of this indeed, the texture and make is exactly the same
  with common Sponges, but onely that both the holes and the <i>fibres</i>,
  or texture of it is exceedingly much bigger, for some of the holes were
  above an Inch and half over, and the <i>fibres</i> and <i>texture</i> of
  it was bigg enough to be distinguished easily with ones eye, but
  conspicuously with an ordinary single <i>Microscope</i>. And these
  indeed, seem'd to have been the habitation of some Animal; and examining
  <i>Aristotle</i>, I find a very consonant account hereunto, namely, that
  he had known a certain little Animal, call'd <i>Pinnothera</i>, like a
  Spider, to be bred in those caverns of a Sponge, from within which, by
  opening and closing those holes, he insnares and catches the little
  Fishes; and in another place he says, That 'tis very confidently
  reported, that there are certain Moths or Worms that reside in the
  cavities of a Sponge, and are there nourished: Notwithstanding all which
  Histories, I think it well worth the enquiring into the History and
  nature of a Sponge, it seeming to promise some information of the Vessels
  in Animal substances, which (by reason of the solidity of the interserted
  flesh that is not easily remov'd, without destroying also those
  interspers'd Vessels) are hitherto undiscover'd; whereas here in a
  Sponge, the <i>Parenchyma</i>, it seems, is but a kind of mucous gelly,
  which is very easily and cleerly wash'd away.</p>

  <p>The reason that makes me imagine, that there may probably be some such
  texture in Animal substances, is, that examining the texture of the
  filaments of tann'd Leather, I find it to be much of the same nature and
  strength of a Sponge; and with my <i>Microscope</i>, I have observ'd many
  such joints and knobs, as I have described in Sponges, the <i>fibres</i>
  also in the hollow of several sorts of Bones, after the Marrow has been
  remov'd, I have found somewhat to resemble this texture, though, I
  confess, I never yet found any texture exactly the same, nor any for
  curiosity comparable to it.</p>

  <p>The filaments of it are much smaller then those of Silk, and through
  the <i>Microscope</i> appear very neer as transparent, nay, some parts of
  them I have observ'd much more.</p>

  <p>Having examin'd also several kinds of Mushroms, I finde their texture
  to be somewhat of this kind, that is, to consist of an infinite company
  of small filaments, every way contex'd and woven together, so as to make
  a kind of cloth, and more particularly, examining a piece of Touch-wood
  (which is a kind <i>Jews-ear</i>, or Mushrom, growing here in
  <i>England</i> also, on several sorts of Trees,
  such as Elders, Maples, Willows, <i>&amp;c.</i> and is commonly call'd by
  the name of <i>Spunk</i>; but that we meet with to be sold in Shops, is
  brought from beyond Seas) I found it to be made of an exceeding delicate
  texture: For the substance of it feels, and looks to the naked eye, and
  may be stretch'd any way, exactly like a very fine piece of
  <i>Chamois</i> Leather, or wash'd Leather, but it is of somewhat a
  browner hew, and nothing neer so strong; but examining it with my
  <i>Microscope</i>, I found it of somewhat another make then any kind of
  Leather; for whereas both <i>Chamois</i>, and all other kinds of Leather
  I have yet view'd, consist of an infinite company of filaments, somewhat
  like bushes interwoven one within another, that is, of bigger parts or
  stems, as it were, and smaller branchings that grow out of them; or like
  a heap of Ropes ends, where each of the larger Ropes by degrees seem to
  split or untwist, into many smaller Cords, and each of those Cords into
  smaller Lines, and those Lines into Threads, <i>&amp;c.</i> and these
  strangely intangled, or interwoven one within another: The texture of
  this Touch-wood seems more like that of a Lock or a Fleece of Wool, for
  it consists of an infinite number of small filaments, all of them, as
  farr as I could perceive, of the same bigness like those of a Sponge, but
  that the <i>filaments</i> of this were not a twentieth part of the
  bigness of those of a Sponge; and I could not so plainly perceive their
  joints, or their manner of interweaving, though, as farr as I was able to
  discern with that <i>Microscope</i> I had, I suppose it to have some kind
  of resemblance, but the joints are nothing neer so thick, nor without
  much trouble visible.</p>

  <p>The filaments I could plainly enough perceive to be even, round,
  cylindrical, transparent bodies, and to cross each other every way, that
  is, there were not more seem'd to lie <i>horizontally</i> then
  <i>perpendicularly</i> and thwartway, so that it is somewhat difficult
  to conceive how they should grow in that manner. By tearing off a small
  piece of it, and looking on the ragged edge, I could among several of
  those <i>fibres</i> perceive small joints, that is, one of those hairs
  split into two, each of the same bigness with the other out of which they
  seem'd to grow, but having not lately had an opportunity of examining
  their manner of growth, I cannot positively affirm any thing of them.</p>

  <p>But to proceed, The swelling of Sponges upon wetting, and the rising
  of the Water in it above the surface of the Water that it touches, are
  both from the same cause, of which an account is already given in the
  sixth Observation.</p>

  <p>The substance of them indeed, has so many excellent properties, scarce
  to be met with in any other body in the world, that I have often wondered
  that so little use is made of it, and those onely vile and sordid;
  certainly, if it were well consider'd, it would afford much greater
  conveniencies.</p>

  <p>That use which the Divers are said to make of it, seems, if true, very
  strange, but having made trial of it my self, by dipping a small piece of
  it in very good Sallet-oyl, and putting it in my mouth, and then keeping
  my mouth and nose under water, I could not find any such thing; for I
  was as soon out of breath as if I had had
  no Sponge, nor could I fetch my breath without taking in water at my
  mouth; but I am very apt to think, that were there a contrivance whereby
  the expir'd air might be forc'd to pass through a wet or oyly Sponge
  before it were again inspir'd, it might much cleanse, and strain away
  from the Air divers fuliginous and other noisome steams, and the dipping
  of it in certain liquors might, perhaps, so renew that property in the
  Air which it loses in the Lungs, by being breath'd, that one square foot
  of Air might last a man for respiration much longer, perhaps, then ten
  will now serve him of common Air.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXXIII" id="obsXXIII">XXIII</a>. <i>Of the curious texture of </i>Sea-weeds<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>For curiosity and beauty, I have not among all the Plants or
  Vegetables I have yet observ'd, seen any one comparable to this Sea-weed
  I have here describ'd, of which I am able to say very little more then
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-09.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 9.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 2.
</span>
  what is represented by the second <i>Figure</i> of the ninth
  <i>Scheme</i>: Namely, that it is a Plant which grows upon the Rocks
  under the water, and increases and spreads it self into a great tuft,
  which is not onely handsomely branch'd into several leaves, but the whole
  surface of the Plant is cover'd over with a most curious kind of carv'd
  work, which consists of a texture much resembling a Honey-comb; for the
  whole surface on both sides is cover'd over with a multitude of very
  small holes, being no bigger then so many holes made with the point of a
  small Pinn, and rang'd in the neatest and most delicate order imaginable,
  they being plac'd in the manner of a <i>Quincunx</i>, or very much like
  the rows of the eyes of a Fly, the rows or orders being very regular,
  which way soever they are observ'd: what the texture was, as it appear'd
  through a pretty bigg Magnifying <i>Microscope</i>, I have here adjoin'd
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-14.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 14.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 1.
</span>
  in the first <i>Figure</i> of the 14. <i>Scheme.</i> which round Area
  ABCD represents a part of the surface about one eighth part of an Inch in
  Diameter: Those little holes, which to the eye look'd round, like so many
  little spots, here appear'd very regularly shap'd holes, representing
  almost the shape of the sole of a round toed shoe, the hinder part of
  which, is, as it were, trod on or cover'd by the toe of that next below
  it; these holes seem'd wall'd about with a very thin and transparent
  substance, looking of a pale straw-colour; from the edge of which,
  against the middle of each hole, were sprouted out four small transparent
  straw-colour'd Thorns, which seem'd to protect and cover those cavities,
  from either side two; neer the root of this Plant, were sprouted out
  several small branches of a kind of bastard <i>Coralline</i>, curiously
  branch'd, though small.</p>

  <p>And to confirm this, having lately the opportunity of viewing the
  large Plant (if I may so call it) of a Sponge <i>petrify'd</i>, of which
  I made mention in the last Observation, I found, that each of the
  Branches or Figures of it, did, by the range of its pores, exhibit just
  such a texture, the rows of pores crossing one another,
  much after the manner as the rows of eyes do which are describ'd in the
  26. <i>Scheme</i>: <i>Coralline</i> also, and several sorts of white
  <i>Coral</i>, I have with a <i>Microscope</i> observ'd very curiously
  shap'd. And I doubt not, but that he that shall observe these several
  kinds of Plants that grow upon Rocks, which the Sea sometimes overflows,
  and those heaps of others which are vomited out of it upon the shore, may
  find multitudes of little Plants, and other bodies, which like this will
  afford very beautifull objects for the <i>Microscope</i>; and this
  <i>Specimen</i> here is adjoin'd onely to excite their curiosities who
  have opportunity of observing to examine and collect what they find
  worthy their notice; for the Sea, among terrestrial bodies, is also a
  <i>prolifick</i> mother, and affords as many Instances of
  <i>spontaneous</i> generations as either the Air or Earth.</p>

</span>
  <p>This which is delineated within the circle of the second <i>Figure</i>
  of the 14. <i>Scheme</i>, is a small part of the back or under side of a
  leaf of Rosemary, which I did not therefore make choice of because it had
  any thing peculiar which was not observable with a <i>Microscope</i> in
  several other Plants, but because it exhibits at one view,</p>

  <p>First, a smooth and shining surface, namely, AB, which is a part of
  the upper side of the leaf, that by a kind of hem or doubling of the leaf
  appears on this side. There are multitudes of leaves, which surfaces are
  like this smooth, and as it were quilted, which look like a curious
  quilted bagg of green Silk, or like a Bladder, or some such pliable
  transparent substance, full stuffed out with a green juice or liquor; the
  surface of Rue, or Herbgrass, is polish'd, and all over indented, or
  pitted, like the Silk-worm's Egg, which I shall anon describe; the smooth
  surfaces of other Plants are otherwise quilted, Nature in this, as it
  were, expressing her Needle-work, or imbroidery.</p>

  <p>Next a downy or bushy surface, such as is all the under side almost,
  appearing through the <i>Microscope</i> much like a thicket of bushes,
  and with this kind of Down or Hair the leaves and stalks of multitudes of
  Vegetables are covered; and there seems to be as great a variety in the
  shape, bulk, and manner of the growing of these secundary Plants, as I
  may call them (they being, as it were, a Plant growing out of a Plant, or
  somewhat like the hairs of Animals) as there is to be found amongst small
  shrubs that compose bushes; but for the most part, they consist of small
  transparent parts, some of which grow in the shape of small Needles or
  Bodkins, as on the Thistle, Cowag-ecod and Nettle; others in the form of
  Cat's claws, as in Cliders, the beards of Barley, the edges of several
  sorts of Grass and Reeds, <i>&amp;c.</i> in other, as Coltsfoot,
  Rose-campion, Aps, Poplar, Willow, and almost all other downy Plants,
  they grow in the form of bushes very much diversify'd in each particular
  Plant, That which I have before in the 19.
  Observation noted on Rose-leaves, is of a quite differing kind, and seems
  indeed a real Vegetable, distinct from the leaf.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, among these small bushes are observable an infinite company
  of small round Balls, exactly Globular, and very much resembling Pearls,
  namely, CCCC, of these there maybe multitudes observ'd in Sage, and
  several other Plants, which I suppose was the reason why <i>Athanasius
  Kircher</i> supposed them to be all cover'd with Spiders Eggs, or young
  Spiders, which indeed is nothing else but some kind of gummous
  exsudation, which is always much of the same bigness. At first sight of
  these, I confess, I imagin'd that they might have been some kind of
  <i>matrices</i>, or nourishing receptacles for some small Insect, just as
  I have found Oak-apples, and multitudes of such other large excrescencies
  on the leaves and other parts of Trees and shrubs to be for Flyes, and
  divers other Insects, but observing them to be there all the year, and
  scarce at all to change their magnitude, that conjecture seem'd not so
  probable. But what ever be the use of it, it affords a very pleasant
  object through the <i>Microscope</i>, and may, perhaps, upon further
  examination, prove very luciferous.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXXV" id="obsXXV">XXV</a>. <i>Of the stinging points and juice of </i>Nettles<i>, and
some other venomous Plants.</i></h3>

  <p>A Nettle is a Plant so well known to every one, as to what the
  appearance of it is to the naked eye, that it needs no description; and
  there are very few that have not felt as well as seen it; and therefore
  it will be no news to tell that a gentle and slight touch of the skin by
  a Nettle, does oftentime, not onely create very sensible and acute pain,
  much like that of a burn or scald, but often also very angry and hard
  swellings and inflamations of the parts, such as will presently rise, and
  continue swoln divers hours. These observations, I say, are common
  enough; but how the pain is so suddenly created, and by what means
  continued, augmented for a time, and afterwards diminish'd, and at length
  quite exstinguish'd, has not, that I know, been explain'd by any.</p>

  <p>And here we must have recourse to our <i>Microscope</i>, and that
  will, if almost any part of the Plant be looked on, shew us the whole
  surface of it very thick set with turn-Pikes, or sharp Needles, of the
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-15.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 15.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 1.
</span>
  shape of those represented in the 15. <i>Scheme</i> and first
  <i>Figure</i> by AB, which are visible also to the naked eye; each of
  which consists of two parts very distinct for shape, and differing also
  in quality from one another. For the part A, is shaped very much like a
  round Bodkin, from B tapering till it end in a very sharp point; it is of
  substance very hard and stiff, exceedingly transparent and cleer, and, as
  I by many trials certainly found, is hollow from top to bottom.</p>

  <p>This I found by this Experiment, I had a very convenient
  <i>Microscope</i> with a single Glass which
  drew about half an Inch, this I had fastned into a little frame, almost
  like a pair of Spectacles, which I placed before mine eyes, and so
  holding the leaf of a Nettle at a convenient distance from my eye, I did
  first, with the thrusting of several of these bristles into my skin,
  perceive that presently after I had thrust them in I felt the burning
  pain begin; next I observ'd in divers of them, that upon thrusting my
  finger against their tops, the Bodkin (if I may so call it) did not in
  the least bend, but I could perceive moving up and down within it a
  certain liquor, which upon thrusting the Bodkin against its basis, or
  bagg B, I could perceive to rise towards the top, and upon taking away my
  hand, I could see it again subside, and shrink into the bagg; this I did
  very often, and saw this <i>Phænomenon</i> as plain as I could ever see a
  parcel of water ascend and descend in a pipe of Glass. But the basis
  underneath these Bodkins on which they were fast, were made of a more
  pliable substance, and looked almost like a little bagg of green Leather,
  or rather resembled the shape and surface of a wilde Cucumber, or
  <i>cucumeris asinini</i>, and I could plainly perceive them to be certain
  little baggs, bladders, or receptacles full of water, or as I ghess, the
  liquor of the Plant, which was poisonous, and those small Bodkins were
  but the Syringe-pipes, or Glyster-pipes, which first made way into the
  skin, and then served to convey that poisonous juice, upon the pressing
  of those little baggs, into the interior and sensible parts of the skin,
  which being so discharg'd, does corrode, or, as it were, burn that part
  of the skin it touches; and this pain will sometimes last very long,
  according as the impression is made deeper or stronger.</p>

  <p>The other parts of the leaf or surface of the Nettle, have very little
  considerable, but what is common to most of these kinds of Plants, as the
  ruggedness or indenting, and hairiness, and other roughnesses of the
  surface or out-side of the Plant, of which I may say more in another
  place. As I shall likewise of certain little pretty cleer Balls or Apples
  which I have observed to stick to the sides of these leaves, both on the
  upper and under side, very much like the small Apples which I have often
  observ'd to grow on the leaves of an Oak call'd <i>Oak-apples</i> which
  are nothing but the <i>Matrices</i> of an Infect, as I elsewhere
  shew.</p>

  <p>The chief thing therefore is, how this Plant comes, by so slight a
  touch, to create so great a pain; and the reason of this seems to be
  nothing else, but the corrosive penetrant liquor contain'd in the small
  baggs or bladders, upon which grow out those sharp Syringe-pipes, as I
  before noted; and very consonant to this, is the reason of the pain
  created by the sting of a Bee, Wasp, <i>&amp;c.</i> as I elsewhere shew:
  For by the Dart, which is likewise a pipe, is made a deep passage into
  the skin, and then by the anger of the Fly, is his gally poisonous liquor
  injected; which being admitted among the sensible parts, and so mix'd
  with the humours or <i>stagnating</i> juices of that part, does create an
  Ebullition perhaps, or <i>effervescens</i>, as is usually observ'd in the
  mingling of two differing <i>Chymical saline</i> liquors, by which means
  the parts become swell'd, hard, and very painfull; for thereby the
  nervous and sensible parts are not onely stretch'd and strain'd
  beyond their natural <i>tone</i>, but are
  also prick'd, perhaps, or corroded by the pungent and incongruous parts
  of the intruded liquor.</p>

  <p>And this seems to be the reason, why <i>Aqua fortis</i>, and other
  <i>saline</i> liquors, if they come to touch the sensitive parts, as in a
  cut of the skin, or the like, do so violently and intollerably
  <i>excruciate</i> and torment the Patient. And 'tis not unlikely, but the
  Inventors of that Diabolical practice of poisoning the points of Arrows
  and Ponyards, might receive their first hint from some such Instance in
  natural contrivances, as this of the Nettle: for the ground why such
  poison'd weapons kill so infallibly as they do, seems no other then this
  of our Nettle's stinging; for the Ponyard or Dart makes a passage or
  entrance into the sensitive or vital parts of the body, whereby the
  contagious substance comes to be dissolv'd by, and mix'd with the fluid
  parts or humours of the body, and by that means spreads it self by
  degrees into the whole liquid part of the body, in the same manner, as a
  few grains of Salt, put into a great quantity of Water, will by degrees
  diffuse it self over the whole.</p>

  <p>And this I take to be the reason of killing of Toads, Frogs, Effs, and
  several Fishes, by strewing Salt on their backs (which Experiment was
  shewn to the <i>Royal Society</i> by a very ingenious Gentleman, and a
  worthy Member of it) for those creatures having always a continual
  exsudation, as it were, of slimy and watry parts, sweating out of the
  pores of their skin, the <i>saline</i> particles, by that means obtain a
  <i>vehicle</i>, which conveys them into the internal and vital parts of
  the body.</p>

  <p>This seems also to be the reason why bathing in Mineral waters are
  such soveraign remedies for multitudes of distempers, especially
  chronical; for the liquid &amp; warm <i>vehicles</i> of the Mineral
  particles, which are known to be in very considerable quantities in those
  healing baths, by the body's long stay in them, do by degrees steep and
  insinuate themselves into the pores and parts of the skin, and thereby
  those Mineral particles have their ways and passages open'd to penetrate
  into the inner parts, and mingle themselves with the <i>stagnant</i>
  juices of the several parts; besides, many of those offensive parts which
  were united with those <i>stagnant</i> juices, and which were contrary to
  the natural constitution of the parts, and so become irksome and painfull
  to the body, but could not be discharged, because Nature had made no
  provision for such accidental mischiefs, are, by means of this soaking,
  and filling the pores of the skin with a liquor, afforded a passage
  through that liquor that fills the pores into the ambient fluid, and
  thereby the body comes to be discharged.</p>

  <p>So that 'tis very evident, there may be a good as well as an evil
  application of this Principle. And the ingenious Invention of that
  Excellent person, Doctor <i>Wren</i> of injecting liquors into the veins
  of an Animal, seems to be reducible to this head: I cannot stay, nor is
  this a fit place, to mention the several Experiments made of this kind by
  the most incomparable Mr. <i>Boyle</i>, the multitudes made by the lately
  mention'd <i>Physician</i> Doctor <i>Clark</i>, the History whereof, as
  he has been pleas'd to communicate to the <i>Royal Society</i>, so he may
  perhaps be prevail'd with to make publique himself: But I shall rather
  hint, that certainly, if this Principle were well
  consider'd, there might, besides the further improving of Bathing and
  Syringing into the veins, be thought on several ways, whereby several
  obstinate distempers of a humane body, such as the Gout, Dropsie, Stone,
  <i>&amp;c.</i> might be master'd, and expell'd; and good men might make
  as good a use of it, as evil men have made a perverse and Diabolical.</p>

  <p>And that the filling of the pores of the skin with some fluid
  <i>vehicle</i>, is of no small efficacy towards the preparing a passage
  for several kinds of penetrant juices, and other dissoluble bodies, to
  insinuate themselves within the skin, and into the sensitive parts of the
  body, may be, I think, prov'd by an Instance given us by
  <i>Bellonius</i>, in the 26. <i>Chapter</i> of the second Book of his
  <i>Observations</i>, which containing a very remarkable Story I have here
  transcrib'd: <i>Cum Chamæleonis nigri radices</i> (says he) <i>apud Pagum
  quendam Livadochorio nuncupatum erui curaremus, plurimi Græci &amp; Turcæ
  spectatum venerunt quid erueremus, eas vero frustulatim secabamus, &amp;
  filo trajiciebamus ut facilius exsiccari possent. Turcæ in eo negotio
  occupatos nos videntes, similiter eas radices tractare &amp; secare
  voluerunt: at cum summus esset æstus, &amp; omnes sudore maderent,
  quicunque eam radicem manibus tractaverant sudoremque absterserant, aut
  faciem digitis scalpserant, tantam pruriginem iis locis quos attigerant
  postea senserunt, ut aduri viderentur. Chamæleonis enim nigri radix ea
  virtute pollet, ut cuti applicata ipsam adeo inflammet, ut nec squillæ,
  nec urticæ ullæ centesima parte ita adurent: At prurigo non adeo
  celeriter sese prodit. Post unam aut alteram porro horam, singuli variis
  faciei locis cutem adeo inflammatam habere cæpimus ut tota sanguinea
  videretur, atque quo magis eam confricabamus, tanto magis excitabatur
  prurigo. Fonti assidebamus sub platano, atque initio pro ludicro
  habebamus &amp; ridebamus: at tandem illi plurimum indignati sunt, &amp;
  nisi asseverassemus nunquam expertos tali virtute eam plantam pollere,
  haud dubie male nos multassent, Attamen nostra excusatio fuit ab illis
  facilitus accepta, cum eodem incommodo nos affectos conspicerent. Mirum
  sane quod in tantillo radice tam ingentem efficaciam nostro malo experti
  sumus.</i></p>

  <p>By which observation of his, it seems manifest, that their being all
  cover'd with sweat who gather'd and cut this root of the black
  <i>Chameleon</i> Thistle, was the great reason why they suffer'd that
  inconvenience, for it seems the like circumstance had not been before
  that noted, nor do I find any mention of such a property belonging to
  this Vegetable in any of the Herbals I have at present by me.</p>

  <p>I could give very many Observations which I have made of this kind,
  whereby I have found that the best way to get a body to be insinuated
  into the substance or insensible pores of another, is first, to find a
  fluid <i>vehicle</i> that has some congruity, both to the body to be
  insinuated, and to the body into whose pores you would have the other
  convey'd. And in this Principle lies the great mystery of staining
  several sorts of bodies, as Marble, Woods, Bones, <i>&amp;c.</i> and of
  Dying Silks, Cloaths, Wools, Feathers, <i>&amp;c.</i> But these being
  digressions, I shall proceed to:</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXXVI" id="obsXXVI">XXVI</a>. <i>Of </i>Cowage<i>, and the itching operation of some bodies.</i></h3>

  <p>There is a certain Down of a Plant, brought from the
  <i>East-Indies</i>, call'd commonly, though very improperly,
  <i>Cow-itch</i>, the reason of which mistake
  is manifest enough from the description of it, which Mr. <i>Parkinson</i>
  sets down in his <i>Herbal</i>, Tribe XI. Chap. 2. <i>Phasiolus siliqua
  hirsuta; The hairy Kidney-bean, called in </i>Zurratte<i> where it grows,
  Couhage: We have had</i> (says he) <i>another of this kind brought us out
  of the </i>East-Indies<i>, which being planted was in shew like the
  former, but came not to perfection, the unkindly season not suffering it
  to shew the flower; but of the Cods that were brought, some were smaller,
  shorter, and rounder then the Garden kind; others much longer, and many
  growing together, as it were in clusters, and cover'd all over with a
  brown short hairiness, so fine, that if any of it be rubb'd, or fall on
  the back of ones hand, or other tender parts of the skin, it will cause a
  kind of itching, but not strong, nor long induring, but passing quickly
  away, without either danger or harm; the Beans were smaller then
  ordinary, and of a black shining colour.</i></p>

  <p>Having one of these Cods given me by a Sea-Captain, who had frequented
  those parts, I found it to be a small Cod, about three Inches long, much
  like a short Cod of <i>French Beans</i>, which had six Beans in it, the
  whole surface of it was cover'd over with a very thick and shining brown
  Down or Hair, which was very fine, and for its bigness stiff; taking some
  of this Down, and rubbing it on the back of my hand, I found very little
  or no trouble, only I was sensible that several of these little downy
  parts with rubbing did penetrate, and were sunk, or stuck pretty deep
  into my skin. After I had thus rubb'd it for a pretty while, I felt very
  little or no pain, in so much that I doubted, whether it were the true
  Couhage; but whil'st I was considering; I found the Down begin to make my
  hand itch, and in some places to smart again, much like the stinging of a
  Flea or Gnat, and this continued a pretty while, so that by degrees I
  found my skin to be swell'd with little red pustules, and to look as if
  it had been itchie. But suffering it without rubbing or scratching, the
  itching tickling pain quickly grew languid, and within an hour I felt
  nothing at all, and the little <i>protuberancies</i> were vanish'd.</p>

  <p>The cause of which odd <i>Phænomenon</i>, I suppose to be much the
  same with that of the stinging of a Nettle, for by the <i>Microscope</i>,
  I discover'd this Down to consist of a multitude of small and slender
  conical bodies, much resembling Needles or Bodkins, such as are
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-16.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 16.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 1.
</span>
  represented by AB. CD. EF. of the first Figure of the XVI. <i>Scheme</i>;
  that their ends AAA, were very sharp, and the substance of them stiff and
  hard, much like the substance of several kinds of Thorns and crooks
  growing on Trees. And though they appear'd very cleer and transparent,
  yet I could not perceive whether they were hollow or not, but to me they
  appear'd like solid transparent bodies, without any cavity in them;
  whether, though they might not be a kind of Cane, fill'd with some
  transparent liquor which was hardned (because the Cod which I had was
  very dry) I was not able to examine.</p>

  <p>Now, being such stiff, sharp bodies, it is easie to conceive, how with
  rubbing they might easily be thrust into the tender parts of the skin,
  and there, by reason of their exceeding fineness and driness, not create
  any considerable trouble or pain, till by remaining in those places
  moistned with the humours of the body, some caustick part sticking on
  them, or residing within them might be dissolv'd and
  mix'd with the ambient juices of that place, and thereby those
  <i>fibres</i> and tender parts adjoyning become affected, and as it were
  corroded by it; whence, while that action lasts, the pains created are
  pretty sharp and pungent, though small, which is the essential property
  of an itching one.</p>

  <p>That the pain also caused by the stinging of a Flea, a Gnat, a Flie, a
  Wasp, and the like, proceeds much from the very same cause, I elsewhere
  in their proper places endeavour to manifest. The stinging also of shred
  Hors-hair, which in meriment is often strew'd between the sheets of a
  Bed, seems to proceed from the same cause.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXXVII" id="obsXXVII">XXVII</a>. <i>Of the </i>Beard<i> of a wilde </i>Oat<i>, and the use that
may be made of it for exhibiting always to the Eye the temperature
of the Air, as to driness and moisture.</i></h3>

  <p>This Beard of a wild <i>Oat</i>, is a body of a very curious
  structure, though to the naked Eye it appears very slight, and
  inconsiderable, it being only a small black or brown Beard or Bristle,
  which grows out of the side of the inner Husk that covers the Grain of a
  wild <i>Oat</i>; the whole length of it, when put in Water, so that it
  may extend it self to its full length, is not above an Inch and a half,
  and for the most part somewhat shorter, but when the Grain is ripe, and
  very dry, which is usualy in the Moneths of <i>July</i>, and
  <i>August</i>, this Beard is bent somewhat below the middle, namely,
  about 2/5 from the bottom of it, almost to a right Angle, and the under
  part of it is wreath'd lik a With; the substance of it is very brittle
  when dry, and it will very easily be broken from the husk on which it
  grows.</p>

  <p>If you take one of these Grains, and wet the Beard in Water, you will
  presently see the small bended top to turn and move round, as if it were
  sensible; and by degrees, if it be continued wet enough, the joint or
  knee will streighten it self; and if it be suffer'd to dry again, it will
  by degrees move round another way, and at length bend again into its
  former posture.</p>

  <p>If it be view'd with an ordinary single <i>Microscope</i>, it will
  appear like a small wreath'd Sprig, with two clefts; and if wet as
  before, and then look'd on with this <i>Microscope</i>, it will appear to
  unwreath it self, and by degrees, to streighten its knee, and the two
  clefts will become streight, and almost on opposite sides of the small
  cylindrical body.</p>

  <p>If it be continued to be look'd on a little longer with a
  <i>Microscope</i>, it will within a little while begin to wreath it self
  again, and soon after return to its former posture, bending it self again
  neer the middle, into a kind of knee or angle.</p>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-15.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 15.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 2.
</span>
  <p>Several of those bodies I examin'd with larger <i>Microscopes</i>, and
  there found them much of the make of those two long wreath'd cylinders
  delineated in the second Figure of the 15. <i>Scheme</i>, which two
  cylinders represent the wreathed part broken
  into two pieces, whereof the end AB is to be suppos'd to have join'd to
  the end CD, so that EACF does represent the whole wreath'd part of the
  Beard, and EG a small piece of the upper part of the Beard which is
  beyond the knee, which as I had not room to insert, so was it not very
  considerable, either for its form, or any known property; but the under
  or wreathed part is notable for both: As to its form, it appear'd, if it
  were look'd on side-ways, almost like a Willow, or a small tapering rod
  of <i>Hazel</i>, the lower or bigger half of which onely, is twisted
  round several times, in some three, in others more, in others less,
  according to the bigness and maturity of the Grain on which it grew, and
  according to the driness and moisture of the ambient Air, as I shall shew
  more at large by and by.</p>

  <p>The whole outward Superficies of this Cylindrical body is curiously
  adorned or fluted with little channels, and interjacent ridges, or little
  <i>protuberances</i> between them, which run the whole length of the
  Beard, and are streight where the Beard is not twisted, and wreath'd
  where it is, just after the same manner: each of those sides is beset
  pretty thick with small Brides or Thorns, somewhat in form resembling
  that of <i>Porcupines</i> Quills, such as <i>aaaaa</i> in the Figure; all
  whose points are directed like so many Turn-pikes towards the small end
  or top of the Beard, which is the reason, why, if you endeavour to draw
  the Beard between your fingers the contrary way, you will find it to
  stick, and grate, as it were, against the skin.</p>

  <p>The proportion of these small conical bodies <i>aaaaa</i> to that
  whereon they grow, the Figure will sufficiently shew, as also their
  manner of growing, their thickness, and neerness to each other, as, that
  towards the root or bottom of the Beard, they are more thin, and much
  shorter, insomuch that there is usually left between the top of the one,
  and the bottom of that next above it, more then the length of one of
  them, and that towards the top of the Beard they grow more thick and
  close (though there be fewer ridges) so that the root, and almost half
  the upper are hid by the tops of those next below them.</p>

  <p>I could not perceive any <i>transverse</i> pores, unless the whole
  wreath'd part were separated and cleft, in those little channels, by the
  wreathing into so many little strings as there were ridges, which was
  very difficult to determine; but there were in the wreathed part two very
  conspicuous channels or clefts, which were continued from the bottom F to
  the elbow bow EH or all along the part which was wreath'd, which seem'd
  to divide the wreath'd Cylinder into two parts, a bigger and a less; the
  bigger was that which was at the <i>convex</i> side of the knee, namely,
  on the side A, and was wreath'd by OOOOO; this, as it seem'd the broader,
  so did it also the longer, the other PPPPP, which was usually purs'd or
  wrinckled in the bending of the knee, as about E, seem'd both the shorter
  and narrower, so that at first I thought the wreathing and unwreathing of
  the Beard might have been caus'd by the shrinking or swelling of that
  part; but upon further examination, I sound that the clefts, KK, LL, were
  stuft up with a kind of Spongie substance, which, for the most part, was
  very conspicuous neer the knee, as in the
  cleft KK, when the Beard was dry; upon the discovery of which, I began to
  think, that it was upon the swelling of this porous pith upon the access
  of moisture or water that the Beard, being made longer in the midst, was
  streightned, and by the shrinking or subsiding of the parts of that
  Spongie substance together, when the water or moisture was exhal'd or
  dried, the pith or middle parts growing shorter, the whole became
  twisted.</p>

  <p>But this I cannot be positive in, for upon cutting the wreath'd part
  in many places transversly, I was not so well satisfy'd with the shape
  and manner of the pores of the pith; for looking on these transverse
  Sections with a very good <i>Microscope</i>, I found that the ends of
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-15.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 15.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 3.
</span>
  those transverse Sections appear'd much of the manner of the third Figure
  of the 15. <i>scheme</i> ABCFE, and the middle of pith CC, seem'd very
  full of pores indeed, but all of them seem'd to run the long-ways.</p>

  <p>This Figure plainly enough shews in what manner those clefts, K and L
  divided the wreath'd Cylinder into two unequal parts, and also of what
  kind of substance the whole body consists; for by cutting the same Beard
  in many places, with transverse Sections, I found much the same
  appearance with this express'd; so that those pores seem to run, as in
  most other such Cany bodies, the whole length of it.</p>

  <p>The clefts of this body KK, and LL, seem'd (as is also express'd in
  the Figure) to wind very oddly in the inner part of the wreath, and in
  some parts of them, they seem'd stuffed, as it were, with that Spongie
  substance, which I just now described.</p>

  <p>This so oddly constituted Vegetable substance, is first (that I have
  met with) taken notice of by <i>Baptista Porta</i>, in his <i>Natural
  Magick</i>, as a thing known to children and Juglers, and it has been
  call'd by some of those last named persons, the better to cover their
  cheat, the Legg of an <i>Arabian Spider</i>, or the Legg of an inchanted
  <i>Egyptian fly</i>, and has been used by them to make a small Index,
  Cross, or the like, to move round upon the wetting of it with a drop of
  Water, and muttering certain words.</p>

  <p>But the use that has been made of it, for the discovery of the various
  constitutions of the Air, as to driness and moistness, is incomparably
  beyond any other, for this it does to admiration: The manner of
  contriving it so, as to perform this great effect, is onely thus:</p>

  <p>Provide a good large Box of Ivory, about four Inches over, and of what
  depth you shall judge convenient (according to your intention of making
  use of one, two, three, or more of these small Beards, ordered in the
  manner which I shall by and by describe) let all the sides of this Box be
  turned of Basket-work (which here in <i>London</i> is easily enough
  procur'd) full of holes, in the manner almost of a Lettice, the bigger,
  or more the holes are, the better, that so the Air may have the more free
  passage to the inclosed Beard, and may the more easily pass through the
  Instrument; it will be better yet, though not altogether so handsom, if
  insteed of the Basket-work on the sides of the Box, the bottom and top of
  the Box be join'd together onely with three or four small Pillars, after
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-15.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 15.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 4.
</span>
  the manner represented in the 4. Figure of the 15.
  <i>Scheme</i>. Or, if you intend to make use of many of these small
  Beards join'd together, you may have a small long Case of Ivory, whose
  sides are turn'd of Basket-work, full of holes, which may be screw'd on
  to the underside of a broad Plate of Ivory, on the other side of which is
  to be made the divided Ring or Circle, to which divisions the pointing of
  the Hand or Index, which is moved by the conjoin'd Beard, may shew all
  the <i>Minute</i> variations of the Air.</p>

  <p>There may be multitudes of other ways for contriving this small
  Instrument, so as to produce this effect, which any one may, according to
  his peculiar use, and the exigency of his present occasion, easily enough
  contrive and take, on which I shall not therefore insist. The whole
  manner of making any one of them is thus: Having your Box or frame AABB,
  fitly adapted for the free passage of the Air through it, in the midst of
  the bottom BBB, you must have a very small hole C, into which the lower
  end of the Beard is to be fix'd, the upper end of which Beard <i>ab</i>,
  is to pass through a small hole of a Plate, or top AA, if you make use
  onely of a single one, and on the top of it <i>e</i>, is to be fix'd a
  small and very light <i>Index</i> <i>fg</i>, made of a very thin sliver
  of a Reed or Cane; but if you make use of two or more Beards, they must
  be fix'd and bound together, either with a very fine piece of Silk, or
  with a very small touch of hard Wax, or Glew, which is better, and the
  <i>Index</i> <i>fg</i>, is to be fix'd on the top of the second, third,
  or fourth in the same manner as on the single one.</p>

  <p>Now, because that in every of these contrivances, the <i>Index</i>
  <i>fg</i>, will with some temperatures of Air, move two, three, or more
  times round, which without some other contrivance then this, will be
  difficult to distinguish, therefore I thought of this Expedient: The
  <i>Index</i> or <i>Hand</i> <i>fg</i>, being rais'd a pretty way above
  the surface of the Plate AA, fix in at a little distance from the middle
  of it a small Pin <i>h</i>, so as almost to touch the surface of the
  Plate AA, and then in any convenient place of the surface of the Plate,
  fix a small Pin, on which put on a small piece of Paper, or thin
  Past-board, Vellom, or Parchment, made of a convenient cize, and shap'd
  in the manner of that in the Figure express'd by <i>ik</i>, so that
  having a convenient number of teeth every turn or return of the Pin
  <i>h</i>, may move this small indented Circle, a tooth forward or
  backwards, by which means the teeth of the Circle, being mark'd, it will
  be thereby very easie to know certainly, how much variation any change of
  weather will make upon the small wreath'd body. In the making of this
  Secundary Circle of Vellom, or the like, great care is to be had, that it
  be made exceeding light, and to move very easily, for otherwise a small
  variation will spoil the whole operation. The Box may be made of Brass,
  Silver, Iron, or any other substance, if care be taken to make it open
  enough, to let the Air have a sufficiently free access to the Beard. The
  <i>Index</i> also may be various ways contrived, so as to shew both the
  number of the revolutions it makes, and the <i>Minute</i> divisions of
  each revolution.</p>

  <p>I have made several trials and Instruments for discovering the driness
  and moisture of the Air with this little wreath'd body, and find it to
  vary exceeding sensibly with the least change in the constitution of the
  Air, as to driness and moisture, so that with one
  breathing upon it, I have made it untwist a whole bout, and the
  <i>Index</i> or <i>Hand</i> has shew'd or pointed to various divisions on
  the upper Face or Ring of the Instrument, according as it was carried
  neerer and neerer to the fire, or as the heat of the Sun increased upon
  it.</p>

  <p>Other trials I have made with Gut-strings, but find them nothing neer
  so sensible, though they also may be so contriv'd as to exhibit the
  changes of the Air, as to driness and moisture, both by their stretching
  and shrinking in length, and also by their wreathing and unwreathing
  themselves; but these are nothing neer so exact or so tender, for their
  varying property will in a little time change very much. But there are
  several other Vegetable substances that are much more sensible then even
  this Beard of a wilde <i>Oat</i>; such I have found the Beard of the seed
  of Musk-grass, or <i>Geranium moschatum</i>, and those of other kinds of
  <i>Cranes-bil</i> seeds, and the like. But always the smaller the
  wreathing substance be, the more sensible is it of the mutations of the
  Air, a conjecture at the reason of which I shall by and by add.</p>

  <p>The lower end of this wreath'd Cylinder being stuck upright in a
  little soft Wax, so that the bended part or <i>Index</i> of it lay
  <i>horizontal</i>, I have observ'd it always with moisture to unwreath it
  self from the East (For instance) by the South to the West, and so by the
  North to the East again, moving with the Sun (as we commonly say) and
  with heat and drouth to re-twist; and wreath it self the contrary way,
  namely, from the East, (for instance) by the North to the West, and so
  onwards.</p>

  <p>The cause of all which <i>Phænomena</i>, seems to be the differing
  texture of the parts of these bodies, each of them (especially the Beard
  of a wilde <i>Oat</i>, and of <i>Mosk-grass</i> seed) seeming to have two
  kind of substances, one that is very porous, loose, and spongie, into
  which the watry steams of the Air may be very easily forced, which will
  be thereby swell'd and extended in its dimensions, just as we may observe
  all kind of Vegetable substance upon steeping in water to swell and grow
  bigger and longer. And a second that is more hard and close, into which
  the water can very little, or not at all penetrate, this therefore
  retaining always very neer the same dimensions, and the other stretching
  and shrinking, according as there is more or less moisture or water in
  its pores, by reason of the make and shape of the parts, the whole body
  must necessarily unwreath and wreath it self.</p>

  <p>And upon this Principle, it is very easie to make several sorts of
  contrivances that should thus wreath and unwreath themselves, either by
  heat and cold, or by driness and moisture, or by any greater or less
  force, from whatever cause it proceed, whether from gravity or weight, or
  from wind which is motion of the Air, or from some springing body, or the
  like.</p>

  <p>This, had I time, I should enlarge much more upon; for it seems to me
  to be the very first footstep of <i>Sensation</i>, and Animate motion,
  the most plain, simple, and obvious contrivance that Nature has made use
  of to produce a motion; next to that of Rarefaction and Condensation by
  heat and cold. And were this Principle very well
  examin'd, I am very apt to think, it would afford us a very great help to
  find out the <i>Mechanism</i> of the Muscles, which indeed, as farr as I
  have hitherto been able to examine, seems to me not so very perplex as
  one might imagine, especially upon the examination which I made of the
  Muscles of <i>Crabs</i>, <i>Lobsters</i>, and several sorts of large
  Shell-fish, and comparing my Observations on them, with the circumstances
  I observ'd in the muscles of terrestrial Animals.</p>

  <p>Now, as in this Instance of the Beard of a wilde <i>Oat</i>, we see
  there is nothing else requisite to make it wreath and unwreath it self,
  and to streighten and bend its knee, then onely a little breath of moist
  or dry Air, or a small <i>atome</i> almost of water or liquor, and a
  little heat to make it again evaporate, for, by holding this Beard,
  plac'd and fix'd as I before directed, neer a Fire, and dipping the tip
  of a small shred of Paper in well rectify'd spirit of Wine, and then
  touching the wreath'd <i>Cylindrical</i> part, you may perceive it to
  untwist it self; and presently again, upon the <i>avolation</i> of the
  spirit, by the great heat, it will re-twist it self, and thus will it
  move forward and backwards as oft as you repeat the touching it with the
  spirit of Wine; so may, perhaps, the shrinking and relaxing of the
  muscles be by the influx and evaporation of some kind of liquor or juice.
  But of this Enquiry I shall add more elsewhere.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXXVIII" id="obsXXVIII">XXVIII</a>. <i>Of the Seeds of </i>Venus<i> looking-glass, or </i>Corn<i>
Violet.</i></h3>

  <p>From the Leaves, and Downs, and Beards of Plants, we come at last to
  the Seeds; and here indeed seems to be the Cabinet of Nature, wherein are
  laid up its Jewels. The providence of Nature about Vegetables, is in no
  part manifested more, then in the various contrivances about the seed,
  nor indeed is there in any part of the Vegetable so curious carvings, and
  beautifull adornments, as about the seed; this in the larger sorts of
  seeds is most evident to the eye; nor is it lest manifest through the
  <i>Microscope</i>, in those seeds whose shape and structure, by reason of
  their smalness, the eye is hardly able to distinguish.</p>

  <p>Of these there are multitudes, many of which I have observ'd through a
  <i>Microscope</i>, and find, that they do, for the most part, every one
  afford exceeding pleasant and beautifull objects. For besides those that
  have various kinds of carv'd surfaces, there are other that have smooth
  and perfectly polish'd surfaces, others a downy hairy surface; some are
  cover'd onely with a skin, others with a kind of shell, others with both,
  as is observable also in greater seeds.</p>

  <p>Of these seeds I have onely described four sorts which may serve as a
  <i>specimen</i> of what the inquisitive observers are likely to find
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-17.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 17.</a>
</span>
  among the rest. The first of these seeds which are described in the 17.
  <i>Scheme</i>, are those of Corn-Violets, the seed is very small, black,
  and shining, and, to the naked eye, looks almost like a very small Flea;
  But through the <i>Microscope</i>, it appears a large body,
  cover'd with a tough thick and bright reflecting skin very irregularly
  shrunk and pitted, insomuch that it is almost an impossibility to find
  two of them wrinkled alike, so great a variety may there be even in this
  little seed.</p>

  <p>This, though it appear'd one of the most promising seeds for beauty to
  the naked eye, yet through the <i>Microscope</i> it appear'd but a rude
  mishapen seed, which I therefore drew, that I might thereby manifest how
  unable we are by the naked eye to judge of beauteous or less curious
  <i>microscopical</i> Objects; cutting some of them in sunder, I observ'd
  them to be fill'd with a greenish yellow pulp, and to have a very thick
  husk, in proportion to the pulp.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXXIX" id="obsXXIX">XXIX</a>. <i>Of the Seeds of </i>Tyme<i>.</i></h3>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-18.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 18.</a>
</span>
  <p>These pretty fruits here represented, in the 18. <i>Scheme</i>, are
  nothing else, but nine several seeds of Tyme; they are all of them in
  differing posture, both as to the eye and the light; nor are they all of
  them exactly of the same shape, there being a great variety both in the
  bulk and figure of each seed; but they all agreed in this, that being
  look'd on with a <i>Microscope</i>, they each of them exactly resembled a
  Lemmon or Orange dry'd; and this both in shape and colour. Some of them
  are a little rounder, of the shape of an Orange, as A and B, they have
  each of them a very conspicuous part by which they were join'd to their
  little stalk, and one of them had a little piece of stalk remaining on;
  the opposite side of the seed, you may perceive very plainly by the
  Figure, is very copped and prominent, as is very usual in Lemmons; which
  prominencies are express'd in D, E and F.</p>

  <p>They seem'd each of them a little creas'd or wrinckled, but E was very
  conspicuously furrow'd, as if the inward make of this seed had been
  somewhat like that of a Lemmon also, but upon dividing several seeds with
  a very sharp Pen-knife, and examining them afterward, I found their make
  to be in nothing but bulk differing from that of Peas, that is, to have a
  pretty thick coat, and all the rest an indifferent white pulp, which
  seem'd very close; so that it seems Nature does not very much alter her
  method in the manner of inclosing and preserving the vital Principle in
  the seed, in these very small grains, from that of Beans, Peas,
  <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>The Grain affords a very pretty Object for the <i>Microscope</i>,
  namely, a Dish of Lemmons plac'd in a very little room; should a Lemmon
  or Nut be proportionably magnify'd to what this seed of Tyme is, it would
  make it appear as bigg as a large Hay-reek and it would be no great
  wonder to see <i>Homers Iliads</i>, and <i>Homer</i> and all, cramm'd
  into such a Nutshell. We may perceive even in these small Grains, as well
  as in greater, how curious and carefull Nature is in preserving the
  seminal principle of Vegetable bodies, in what delicate, strong and most
  convenient Cabinets she lays them and closes them in
  a pulp for their safer protection from outward dangers, and for the
  supply of convenient alimental juice, when the heat of the Sun begins to
  animate and move these little <i>automatons</i> or Engines; as if she
  would, from the ornaments wherewith she has deckt these Cabinets, hint to
  us, that in them she has laid up her Jewels and Master-pieces. And this,
  if we are but diligent in observing, we shall find her method throughout.
  There is no curiosity in the Elemental kingdom, if I may so call the
  bodies of Air, Water, Earth, that are comparable in form to those of
  Minerals, Air and Water having no form at all, unless a potentiality to
  be form'd into Globules; and the clods and parcels of Earth are all
  irregular, whereas in Minerals she does begin to <i>Geometrize</i>, and
  practise, as 'twere, the first principles of <i>Mechanicks</i>, shaping
  them of plain regular figures, as triangles, squares, <i>&amp;c.</i> and
  <i>tetraedrons</i>, cubes, <i>&amp;c.</i> But none of their forms are
  comparable to the more compounded ones of Vegetables; For here she goes a
  step further, forming them both of more complicated shapes, and adding
  also multitudes of curious Mechanick contrivances in their structure; for
  whereas in Vegetables there was no determinate number of the leaves or
  branches, nor no exacly certain figure of leaves, or flowers, or seeds,
  in Animals all those things are exactly defin'd and determin'd; and
  where-ever there is either an excess or defect of those determinate parts
  or limbs, there has been some impediment that has spoil'd the principle
  which was most regular: Here we shall find, not onely most curiously
  compounded shapes, but most stupendious Mechanisms and contrivances, here
  the ornaments are in the highest perfection, nothing in all the Vegetable
  kingdom that is comparable to the deckings of a Peacock; nay, to the
  curiosity of any feather, as I elsewhere shew; nor to that of the
  smallest and most despicable Fly. But I must not stay on these
  speculations, though perhaps it were very well worth while for one that
  had leisure, to see what Information may be learn'd of the nature, or
  use, or virtues of bodies, by their several forms and various
  excellencies and properties. Who knows but <i>Adam</i> might from some
  such contemplation, give names to all creatures? If at least his names
  had any significancy in them of the creatures nature on which he impos'd
  it; as many (upon what grounds I know not) have suppos'd: And who knows,
  but the Creator may, in those characters, have written and engraven many
  of his most mysterious designs and counsels, and given man a capacity,
  which, assisted with diligence and industry, may be able to read and
  understand them. But not to multiply my digression more then I can the
  time, I will proceed to the next, which is,</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXXX" id="obsXXX">XXX</a>. <i>Of the Seeds of </i>Poppy<i>.</i></h3>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-19.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 19.</a>
</span>
  <p>The small seeds of Poppy, which are described in the 19.
  <i>Scheme</i>, both for their smalness, multiplicity and prettiness, as
  also for their admirable soporifick quality, deserve to be taken notice
  of among the other <i>microscopical</i> seeds of
  Vegetables: For first, though they grow in a Case or Hive oftentimes
  bigger then one of these Pictures of the <i>microscopical</i> appearance,
  yet are they for the most part so very little, that they exceed not the
  bulk of a small Nitt, being not above 1/32 part of an Inch in Diameter,
  whereas the Diameter of the Hive of them oftentimes exceeds two Inches,
  so that it is capable of containing near two hundred thousand, and so in
  all likelihood does contain a vast quantity, though perhaps not that
  number. Next, for their prettiness, they may be compar'd to any
  <i>microscopical</i> seed I have yet seen; for they are of a dark
  brownish red colour, curiously Honey-comb'd all over with a very pretty
  variety of Net-work, or a small kind of imbosment of very orderly rais'd
  ridges, the surface of them looking not unlike the inside of a Beev's
  stomack. But that which makes it most considerable of all, is, the
  medicinal virtues of it, which are such as are not afforded us by any
  Mineral preparation; and that is for the procuring of sleep, a thing as
  necessary to the well-being of a creature as his meat, and that which
  refreshes both the voluntary and rational faculties, which, whil'st this
  affection has seis'd the body, are for the most part unmov'd, and at
  rest. And, methinks, Nature does seem to hint some very notable virtue or
  excellency in this Plant from the curiosity it has bestow'd upon it.
  First, in its flower, it is of the highest scarlet-Dye, which is indeed
  the prime and chiefest colour, and has been in all Ages of the world most
  highly esteem'd: Next, it has as much curiosity shew'd also in the husk
  or case of the seed, as any one Plant I have yet met withall; and
  thirdly, the very seeds themselves, the <i>Microscope</i> discovers to be
  very curiously shap'd bodies; and lastly, Nature has taken such abundant
  care for the propagation of it, that one single seed grown into a Plant,
  is capable of bringing some hundred thousands of seeds.</p>

  <p>It were very worthy some able man's enquiry whether the intention of
  Nature, as to the secundary end of Animal and Vegetable substances might
  not be found out by some such characters and notable impressions as
  these, or from divers other circumstances, as the figure, colour, place,
  time of flourishing, springing and fading, duration, taste, smell,
  <i>&amp;c.</i> For if such there are (as an able <i>Physician</i> upon
  good grounds has given me cause to believe) we might then, insteed of
  studying Herbals (where so little is deliver'd of the virtues of a Plant,
  and less of truth) have recourse to the Book of Nature it self, and there
  find the most natural, usefull, and most effectual and specifick
  Medicines, of which we have amongst Vegetables, two very noble Instances
  to incourage such a hope, the one of the <i>Jesuite powder</i> for the
  cure of <i>intermitting Feavers</i>, and the other of the juice of
  <i>Poppy</i> for the curing the defect of sleeping.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXXXI" id="obsXXXI">XXXI</a>. <i>Of </i>Purslane-seed<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>The Seeds of <i>Purslane</i> seem of very notable shapes, appearing
  through the <i>Microscope</i> shap'd somewhat like a <i>nautilus</i> or
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-20.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 20.</a>
</span>
  <i>Porcelane</i> shell, as may be seen in the XX. <i>Scheme</i>, it being
  a small body, coyl'd round in the manner of a Spiral, at the greater end
  whereof, which represents the mouth or orifice of the Shell, there is
  left a little white transparent substance, like a skin, represented by
  BBBB, which seems to have been the place whereunto the stem was join'd.
  The whole surface of this <i>Coclea</i> or Shell, is cover'd over with
  abundance of little <i>prominencies</i> or buttons very orderly rang'd
  into Spiral rows, the shape of each of which seem'd much to resemble a
  Wart upon a mans hand. The order, variety, and curiosity in the shape of
  this little seed, makes it a very pleasant object for the
  <i>Microscope</i>, one of them being cut asunder with a very sharp
  Penknife, discover'd this carved Casket to be of a brownish red, and
  somewhat transparent substance, and manifested the inside to be fill'd
  with a whitish green substance or pulp, the Bed wherein the seminal
  principle lies <i>invelop'd</i>.</p>

  <p>There are multitudes of other seeds which in shape represent or
  imitate the forms of divers other sorts of Shells: as the seed of
  <i>Scurvy-grass</i> very much resembles the make of a <i>Concha
  Venerea</i>, a kind of Purcelane Shell; others represent several sorts of
  larger fruits, sweat Marjerome and Pot-marjerome represent Olives. Carret
  seeds are like a cleft of a Coco-Nut Husk, others are like Artificial
  things, as Succory seeds are like a Quiver full of Arrows, the seeds of
  <i>Amaranthus</i> are of an exceeding lovely shape, somewhat like an Eye:
  The skin of the black and shrivled seeds of Onyons and Leeks, are all
  over knobbed like a Seals skin. Sorrel has a pretty black shining
  three-square seed, which is picked at both ends with three ridges, that
  are bent the whole length of it. It were almost endless to reckon up the
  several shapes, they are so many and so various; Leaving them therefore
  to the curious observer, I shall proceed to the Observations on the parts

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXXXII" id="obsXXXII">XXXII</a>. <i>Of the Figure of several sorts of </i>Hair<i>, and of
the texture of the </i>skin<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Viewing some of the Hairs of my Head with a very good
  <i>Microscope</i>, I took notice of these particulars:</p>

  <p>1. That they were, for the most part, <i>Cylindrical</i>, some of them
  were somewhat <i>Prismatical</i>, but generally they were very neer
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-05.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 5.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 2.
</span>
  round, such as are represented in the second Figure of the 5.
  <i>Scheme</i>, by the <i>Cylinders</i> EEE. nor could I find any that had
  sharp angules.</p>

  <p>2. That that part which was next the top, was bigger then that which
  was neerer the root.</p>

  <p>3. That they were all along from end to end transparent, though not
  very cleer, the end next the root appearing like a black transparent
  piece of Horn, the end next the top more brown, somewhat like transparent
  Horn.</p>

  <p>4. That the root of the Hairs were pretty smooth, tapering inwards,
  almost like a Parsneb; nor could I find that it had any filaments, or any
  other vessels, such as the <i>fibres</i> of Plants.</p>

  <p>5. That the top when split (which is common in long Hair) appear'd
  like the end of a stick, beaten till it be all flitter'd, there being not
  onely two splinters, but sometimes half a score and more.</p>

  <p>6. That they were all, as farr as I was able to find, solid
  <i>Cylindrical</i> bodies, not pervious, like a Cane or Bulrush; nor
  could I find that they had any Pith, or distinction of Rind, or the like,
  such as I had observ'd in Horse-hairs, the Bristles of a Cat, the
  <i>Indian</i> Deer's Hair, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<h3><i>Observations on several other sorts of </i>Hair<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>For the Brisles of a Hogg, I found them to be first a hard transparent
  horny substance, without the least appearance of pores or holes in it;
  and this I try'd with the greatest care I was able, cutting many of them
  with a very sharp Razor, so that they appear'd, even in the Glass, to
  have a pretty smooth surface, but somewhat waved by the sawing to and fro
  of the Razor, as is visible in the end of the <i>Prismatical</i> body A
  of the same Figure; and then making trials with causing the light to be
  cast on them all the various ways I could think of, that was likely to
  make the pores appear, if there had been any, I was not able to discover
  any.</p>

  <p>Next, the Figure of the Brisles was very various, neither perfectly
  round, nor sharp edg'd, but <i>Prismatical</i>, with divers sides, and
  round angles, as appears in the Figure A. The bending of them in any part
  where they before appear'd cleer, would all flaw them, and make them look
  white.</p>

  <p>The Mustacheos of a Cat (part of one of which is represented by the
  short <i>Cylinder</i> B of the same Figure) seem'd to have, all of them
  that I observ'd, a large pith in the middle, like the pith of an Elder,
  whose texture was so close, that I was not able to discover the least
  sign of pores; and those parts which seem to be pores, as they appear'd
  in one position to the light, in another I could find a manifest
  reflection to be cast from them.</p>

  <p>This I instance in, to hint that it is not safe to conclude any thing
  to be positively this or that, though it appear never so plain and likely
  when look'd on with a <i>Microscope</i> in one posture, before the same
  be examin'd by placing it in several other positions.</p>

  <p>And this I take to be the reason why many have believed and asserted
  the Hairs of a man's head to be hollow, and like so many small pipes
  perforated from end to end.</p>

  <p>Now, though I grant that by an <i>Analogie</i> one may suppose them
  so, and from the <i>Polonian</i> disease one
  may believe them such, yet I think we have not the least encouragement to
  either from the <i>Microscope</i>, much less positively to assert them
  such. And perhaps the very essence of the <i>Plica Polonica</i> may be
  the hairs growing hollow, and of an unnatural constitution.</p>

  <p>And as for the <i>Analogie</i>, though I am apt enough to think that
  the hairs of several Animals may be perforated somewhat like a Cane, or
  at least have a kind of pith in them, first, because they seem as 'twere
  a kind of Vegetable growing on an Animal, which growing, they say,
  remains a long while after the Animal is dead, and therefore should like
  other Vegetables have a pith; and secondly, because Horns and Feathers,
  and Porcupine's Quils, and Cats Bristles, and the long hairs of Horses,
  which come very neer the nature of a mans hair, seem all of them to have
  a kind of pith, and some of them to be porous, yet I think it not (in
  these cases, where we have such helps for the sense as the
  <i>Microscope</i> affords) safe concluding or building on more then we
  sensibly know, since we may, with examining, find that Nature does in the
  make of the same kind of substance, often vary her method in framing of
  it: Instances enough to confirm this we may find in the Horns of several
  creatures: as what a vast difference is there between the Horns of an
  Oxe, and those of some sorts of Staggs as to their shape? and even in the
  hairs of several creatures, we find a vast difference, as the hair of a
  man's head seems, as I said before, long, <i>Cylindrical</i> and sometime
  a little <i>Prismatical</i>, solid or impervious, and very small; the
  hair of an <i>Indian</i> Deer (a part of the middle of which is described
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-05.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 5.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 3.
</span>
  in the third Figure of the fifth <i>Scheme</i>, marked with F) is bigger
  in compass through all the middle of it, then the Bristle of an Hogg, but
  the end of it is smaller then the hair of any kind of Animal (as may be
  seen by the Figure G) the whole belly of it, which is about two or three
  Inches long, looks to the eye like a thread of course Canvass, that has
  been newly unwreath'd, it being all wav'd or bended to and fro, much
  after that manner, but through the <i>Microscope</i>, it appears all
  perforated from side to side, and Spongie, like a small kind of spongy
  Coral, which is often found upon the <i>English</i> shores; but though I
  cut it transversly, I could not perceive that it had any pores that ran
  the long-way of the hair: the long hairs of Horses CC and D, seem
  <i>Cylindrical</i> and somewhat pithy; the Bristles of a Cat B, are
  conical and pithy: the Quils of Porcupines and Hedghoggs, being cut
  transversly, have a whitish pith, in the manner of a Starr, or
  Spur-rowel: Piggs-hair (A) is somewhat <i>triagonal</i>, and seems to
  have neither pith nor pore: And other kinds of hair have quite a
  differing structure and form. And therefore I think it no way agreeable
  to a true natural Historian, to pretend to be so sharp-sighted, as to see
  what a pre-conceiv'd <i>Hypothesis</i> tells them should be there, where
  another man, though perhaps as seeing, but not forestall'd, can discover
  no such matter.</p>

  <p>But to proceed; I observ'd several kind of hairs that had been Dyed,
  and found them to be a kind of horny <i>Cylinder</i>, being of much about
  the transparency of a pretty cleer piece of Oxe horn; these appear'd
  quite throughout ting'd with the colours they
  exhibited. And 'tis likely, that those hairs being boyl'd or steep'd in
  those very hot ting'd liquors in the Dye-fat, And the substance of the
  hair being much like that of an Oxes Horn, the penetrant liquor does so
  far mollifie and soften the substance, that it sinks into the very center
  of it, and so the ting'd parts come to be mix'd and united with the very
  body of the hair, and do not (as some have thought) only stick on upon
  the outward surface. And this, the boiling of Horn will make more
  probable; for we shall find by that action, that the water will insinuate
  it self to a pretty depth within the surface of it, especially if this
  penetrancy of the water be much helped by the Salts that are usually
  mix'd with the Dying liquors. Now, whereas Silk may be dyed or ting'd
  into all kind of colours without boiling or dipping into hot liquors, I
  ghess the reason to be two-fold: First, because the filaments, or small
  cylinders of Silk, are abundantly smaller and finer, and so have a much
  less depth to be penetrated then most kind of hairs; and next, because
  the substance or matter of Silk, is much more like a Glew then the
  substance of Hair is. And that I have reason to suppose: First, because
  when it is spun or drawn out of the Worm, it is a perfect glutinous
  substance, and very easily sticks and cleaves to any adjacent body, as I
  have several times observed, both in Silk-worms and Spiders. Next,
  because that I find that water does easily dissolve and mollifie the
  substance again, which is evident from their manner of ordering those
  bottoms or pods of the Silk-worm before they are able to unwind them. It
  is no great wonder therefore, if those Dyes or ting'd liquors do very
  quickly mollifie and tinge the surfaces of so small and so glutinous a
  body. And we need not wonder that the colours appear so lovely in the
  one, and so dull in the other, if we view but the ting'd cylinders of
  both kinds with a good <i>Microscope</i>; for whereas the substance of
  Hair, at best, is but a dirty duskish white somewhat transparent, the
  filaments of Silk have a most lovely transparency and cleerness, the
  difference between those two being not much less then that between a
  piece of Horn, and a piece of Crystal; the one yielding a bright and
  vivid reflection from the concave side of the cylinder, that is, from the
  concave surface of the Air that incompasses the back-part of the
  cylinder; the other yielding a dull and perturb'd reflection from the
  several <i>Heterogeneous</i> parts that compose it. And this difference
  will be manifest enough to the eye, if you get a couple of small
  Cylinders, the smaller of Crystal Glass, the other of Horn, and then
  varnishing them over very thinly with some transparent colour, which will
  represent to the naked eye much the same kind of object which is
  represented to it from the filaments of Silk and Hair by the help of the
  <i>Microscope</i>. Now, since the threads of Silk and Serge are made up
  of a great number of these filaments, we may henceforth cease to wonder
  at the difference. From much the same reason proceeds the vivid and
  lovely colours of Feathers, wherein they very farr exceed the natural as
  well as Artificial colours of hair, of which I shall say more in its
  proper place.</p>

  <p>The Teguments indeed of creatures are all of them adapted to the
  peculiar use and convenience of that Animal which they inwrap; and very
  much also for the ornament and beauty of
  it, as will be most evident to any one that shall attentively consider
  the various kinds of cloathings wherewith most creatures are by Nature
  invested and cover'd. Thus I have observed, that the hair or furr of
  those Northern white Bears that inhabite the colder Regions, is exceeding
  thick and warm: the like have I observ'd of the hair of a
  <i>Greenland</i> Deer, which being brought alive to <i>London</i>, I had
  the opportunity of viewing; its hair was so exceeding thick, long and
  soft, that I could hardly with my hand, grasp or take hold of his skin,
  and it seem'd so exceeding warm, as I had never met with any before. And
  as for the ornamentative use of them, it is most evident in a multitude
  of creatures, not onely for colour, as the Leopards, Cats, Rhein Deer,
  <i>&amp;c</i>. but for the shape, as in Horses manes, Cats beards, and
  several other of the greater sort of terrestrial Animals, but is much
  more conspicuous, in the Vestments of Fishes, Birds, Insects, of which I
  shall by and by give some Instances.</p>

  <p>As for the skin, the <i>Microscope</i> discovers as great a difference
  between the texture of those several kinds of Animals, as it does between
  their hairs; but all that I have yet taken notice of, when tann'd or
  dress'd, are of a Spongie nature, and seem to be constituted of an
  infinite company of small long <i>fibres</i> or hairs, which look not
  unlike a heap of Tow or Okum; every of which <i>fibres</i> seem to have
  been some part of a Muscle, and probably, whil'st the Animal was alive,
  might have its distinct function, and serve for the contraction and
  relaxation of the skin, and for the stretching and shrinking of it this
  or that way.</p>

  <p>And indeed, without such a kind of texture as this, which is very like
  that of <i>Spunk</i> it would seem very strange, how any body so strong
  as the skin of an Animal usually is, and so close as it seems, whil'st
  the Animal is living, should be able to suffer so great an extension any
  ways, without at all hurting or dilacerating any part of it. But, since
  we are inform'd by the <i>Microscope</i>, that it consists of a great
  many small filaments, which are implicated, or intangled one within
  another, almost no otherwise then the hairs in a lock of Wool, or the
  flakes in a heap of Tow, though not altogether so loose, but the
  filaments are here and there twisted, as 'twere, or interwoven, and here
  and there they join and unite with one another, so as indeed the whole
  skin seems to be but one piece, we need not much wonder: And though these
  <i>fibres</i> appear not through a <i>Microscope</i> exactly jointed and
  contex'd, as in Sponge; yet, as I formerly hinted, I am apt to think,
  that could we find some way of discovering the texture of it, whil'st it
  invests the living Animal, or had some very easie way of separating the
  pulp or intercurrent juices, such as in all probability fill those
  <i>Interstitia</i>, without dilacerating, brusing, or otherwise spoiling
  the texture of it (as it seems to be very much by the ways of tanning and
  dressing now us'd) we might discover a much more curious texture then I
  have hitherto been able to find; perhaps somewhat like that of
  Sponges.</p>

  <p>That of <i>Chamoise</i> Leather is indeed very much like that of
  <i>Spunk</i>, save onely that the <i>filaments</i> seem nothing neer so
  even and round, nor altogether so small, nor has it so curious joints as
  <i>Spunk</i> has, some of which I have
  lately discover'd like those of a Sponge, and perhaps all these three
  bodies may be of the same kind of substance, though two of them indeed
  are commonly accounted Vegetable (which, whether they be so or no, I
  shall not now dispute) But this seems common to all three, that they
  undergo a tanning or dressing, whereby the interspers'd juices are wasted
  and wash'd away before the texture of them can be discover'd.</p>

  <p>What their way is of dressing, or curing Sponges, I confess, I cannot
  learn; but the way of dressing <i>Spunk</i>, is, by boiling it a good
  while in a strong <i>Lixivium</i>, and then beating it very well; and the
  manner of dressing Leather is sufficiently known.</p>

  <p>It were indeed extremely desirable, if such a way could be found
  whereby the <i>Parenchyma</i> or flesh of the Muscles, and several other
  parts of the body, might be wash'd, or wafted clean away, without
  vitiating the form of the <i>fibrous</i> parts or vessells of it, for
  hereby the texture of thole parts, by the help of a good
  <i>Microscope</i>, might be most accurately found.</p>

  <p>But to digress no further, we may, from this discovery of the
  <i>Microscope</i>, plainly enough understand how the skin, though it
  looks so close as it does, comes to give a passage to so vast a quantity
  of <i>excrementitious</i> substances, as the diligent <i>Sanctorius</i>
  has excellently observed it to do, in his <i>medicina statica</i>; for it
  seems very probable, from the texture after dressing, that there are an
  infinit of pores that every way pierce it, and that those pores are onely
  fill'd with some kind of juice, or some very pulpy soft substance, and
  thereby the steams may almost as easily find a passage through such a
  fluid <i>vehicle</i> as the vaporous bubbles which are generated at the
  bottom of a Kettle of hot water do find a passage through that fluid
  <i>medium</i> into the ambient Air.</p>

  <p>Nor is the skin of animals only thus pervious, but even those of
  vegetables also seem to be the same; for otherwise I cannot conceive why,
  if two sprigs of Rosemary (for Instance) be taken as exactly alike in all
  particulars as can be, and the one be set with the bottom in a Glass of
  water, and the other be set just without the Glass, but in the Air onely,
  though you stop the lower end of that in the Air very carefully with Wax,
  yet shall it presently almost wither, whereas the other that seems to
  have a supply from the subjacent water by its small pipes, or
  <i>microscopical</i> pores, preserves its greenness for many days, and
  sometimes weeks.</p>

  <p>Now, this to me, seems not likely to proceed from any other cause then
  the <i>avolation</i> of the juice through the skin; for by the Wax, all
  those other pores of the stem are very firmly and closely stop'd up. And
  from the more or less porousness of the skins or rinds of Vegetables may,
  perhaps, be somewhat of the reason given, why they keep longer green, or
  sooner wither; for we may observe by the bladdering and craking of the
  leaves of Bays, Holly, Laurel, <i>&amp;c.</i> that their skins are very
  close, and do not suffer so free a passage through them of the included
  juices.</p>

  <p>But of this, and of the Experiment of the Rosemary, I shall elsewhere
  more fully consider, seeming to me an extreme luciferous Experiment, such
  as seems indeed very plainly to prove the <i>Schematism</i> or structure
  of Vegetables altogether <i>mechanical</i>,
  and as necessary, that (water and warmth being apply'd to the bottom of
  the sprig of a Plant) some of it should be carried upwards into the stem,
  and thence distributed into the leaves, as that the water of the
  <i>Thames</i> covering the bottom of the Mills at the Bridge foot of
  <i>London</i>, and by the ebbing and flowing of it, passing strongly by
  them, should have some part of it convey'd to the Cesterns above, and
  thence into several houses and Cesterns up and down the City.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXXXIII" id="obsXXXIII">XXXIII</a>. <i>Of the </i>Scales<i> of a </i>Soal<i>, and other Fishes.</i></h3>

  <p>Having hinted somewhat of the skin and covering of terrestrial
  Animals, I shall next add an Observation I made on the skin and Scales of
  a <i>Soal</i>, a small Fish, commonly enough known; and here in Fishes,
  as well as other Animals, Nature follows its usual method, framing all
  parts so, as that they are both usefull and ornamental in all its
  composures, mingling <i>utile</i> and <i>dulce</i> together; and both
  these designs it seems to follow, though our unassisted senses are not
  able to peceive them: This is not onely manifest in the covering of this
  Fish, but in multitudes of others, which it would be too long to
  enumerate, witness particularly that small Sand Shell, which I mention'd
  in the XI. Observation, and infinite other small Shells and Scales,
  divers of which I have view'd. This skin I view'd, was flead from a
  pretty large <i>Soal</i>, and then expanded and dry'd, the inside of it,
  when dry, to the naked eye, look'd very like a piece of Canvass, but the
  <i>Microscope</i> discover'd that texture to be nothing else, but the
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-21.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 21.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 2.
</span>
  inner ends of those curious Scolop'd Scales I, I, I, in the second
  <i>Figure</i> of the XXI. <i>Scheme</i>, namely, the part of GGGG (of the
  larger representation of a single Scale, in the first <i>Figure</i> of
  the same <i>Scheme</i>) which on the back side, through an ordinary
  single Magnifying Glass, look'd not unlike the Tyles on an house.</p>

  <p>The outside of it, to the naked eye, exhibited nothing more of
  ornament, save the usual order of ranging the Scales into a
  <i>triagonal</i> form, onely the edges seem'd a little to shine, the
  finger being rubb'd from the tail-wards towards the head, the Scales
  seem'd to stay and raze it; But through an ordinary Magnifying glass, it
  exhibited a most curiously carved and adorned surface, such as is visible
  in the second <i>Figure</i>, each of those (formerly almost
  imperceptible) Scales appearing much of the shape I, I, I, that is, they
  were round, and protuberant, and somewhat shap'd like a Scolop, the whole
  Scale being creas'd with curiously wav'd and indented ridges, with
  proportionable furrows between; each of which was terminated with a very
  sharp transparent bony substance, which, like so many small Turnpikes,
  seem'd to arm the edges.</p>

  <p>The back part KKK was the skin into which each of these Scales were
  very deeply fix'd, in the curious regular order, visible in the second
  <i>Figure</i>. The length and shape of the
  part of the Scale which was buried by the skin, is evidenced by the first
  <i>Figure</i>; which is the representation of one of them pluck'd out and
  view'd through a good <i>Microscope</i>, namely, the part LFGGFL, wherein
  is also more plainly to be seen, the manner of carving of the scolopt
  part of every particular Scale, how each ridge or barr EEE is alternately
  hollowed or engraven, and how every gutter between them is terminated
  with very transparent and hard pointed spikes, and how every other of
  these, as AAAA, are much longer then the interjacent ones, DDD.</p>

  <p>The texture or form also of the hidden part appears, namely, the
  middle part, GGG, seems to consist of a great number of small quills or
  pipes, by which, perhaps, the whole may be nourished; and the side parts
  FF consist of a more fibrous texture, though indeed the whole Scale
  seem'd to be of a very tough gristly substance like the larger Scales of
  other Fishes.</p>

  <p>The Scales of the skin of a Dog-fish (which is us'd by such as work in
  Wood, for the smoothing of their work, and consists plainly enough to the
  naked eye, of a great number off small horny points) through the
  <i>Microscope</i> appear'd each of them curiously ridg'd, and very neatly
  carved; and indeed, you can hardly look on the scales of any Fish, but
  you may discover abundance of curiosity and beautifying; and not only in
  these Fishes, but in the shells and crusts or armour of most sorts of
  <i>Marine</i> Animals so invested.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXXXIV" id="obsXXXIV">XXXIV</a>. <i>Of the Sting of a Bee.</i></h3>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-16.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 16.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 2.
</span>
  <p>The Sting of a <i>Bee</i>, delineated in the second Figure of the XVI.
  <i>Scheme</i>, seems to be a weapon of offence, and is as great an
  Instance, that Nature did realy intend revenge as any, and that first,
  because there seems to be no other use of it. Secondly, by reason of its
  admirable shape, seeming to be purposely shap'd for that very end.
  Thirdly, from the virulency of the liquor it ejects, and the sad effects
  and symptoms that follow it.</p>

  <p>But whatever be the use of it, certain it is, that the structure of it
  is very admirable; what it appears to the naked eye, I need not describe,
  the thing being known almost to every one, but it appears through the
  <i>Microscope</i>, to consist of two parts, the one a sheath, without a
  chape or top, shap'd almost like the Holster of a Pistol, beginning at
  <i>d</i>, and ending at <i>b</i>, this sheath I could most plainly
  perceive to be hollow, and to contain in it, both a Sword or Dart, and
  the poisonous liquor that causes the pain. The sheath or case seem'd to
  have several joints or settings together, marked by <i>fghiklmno</i>, it
  was arm'd moreover neer the top, with several crooks or forks
  (<i>pqrst</i>) on one side, and (<i>pqrstu</i>) on the other, each of
  which seem'd like so many Thorns growing on a briar, or rather like so
  many Cat's Claws; for the crooks themselves seem'd to be little sharp
  transparent points or claws, growing out of little <i>protuberancies</i>
  on the side of the sheath, which, by observing
  the Figure diligently, is easie enough to be perceiv'd; and from several
  particulars, I suppose the Animal has a power of displaying them, and
  shutting them in again as it pleases, as a Cat does its claws, or as an
  Adder or Viper can its teeth or fangs.</p>

  <p>The other part of the Sting was the Sword, as I may so call it, which
  is sheath'd, as it were, in it, the top of which <i>ab</i> appears quite
  through at the smaller end, just as if the chape of the sheath of a Sword
  were lost, and the end of it appear'd beyond the Scabbard; the end of
  this Dart(<i>a</i>) was very sharp, and it was arm'd likewise with the
  like Tenterhooks or claws with those of the sheath, such as (<i>vxy</i>,
  <i>xyzz</i>) these crooks, I am very apt to think, can be clos'd up also,
  or laid flat to the sides of the Sword when it is drawn into the
  Scabbard, as I have several times observ'd it to be, and can be spred
  again or extended when ever the Animal pleases.</p>

  <p>The consideration of which very pretty structure, has hinted to me,
  that certainly the use of these claws seems to be very considerable, as
  to the main end of this Instrument, for the drawing in, and holding the
  sting in the flesh; for the point being very sharp, the top of the Sting
  or Dagger (<i>ab</i>) is very easily thrust into an Animal's body, which
  being once entred, the Bee, by endeavouring to pull it into the sheath,
  draws (by reason of the crooks (<i>vxy</i>) and (<i>xyzz</i>) which lay
  hold of the skin on either side) the top of the sheath (<i>tsrv</i>) into
  the skin after it, and the crooks <i>t</i>, <i>s</i>, and <i>r</i>,
  <i>v</i>, being entred, when the Bee endeavours to thrust out the top of
  the sting out of the sheath again, they lay hold of the skin on either
  side, and do not onely keep the sheath from sliding back, but helps the
  top inwards, and thus, by an alternate and successive retracting and
  emitting of the Sting in and out of the sheath, the little enraged
  creature by degrees makes his revengfull weapon pierce the toughest and
  thickest Hides of his enemies, in so much that some few of these stout
  and resolute soldiers with these little engines, do often put to flight a
  huge masty Bear, one of their deadly enemies, and thereby shew the world
  how much more considerable in Warr a few skilfull Engineers and resolute
  soldiers politickly order'd, that know how to manage such engines, are,
  then a vast unweildy rude force, that confides in, and acts onely by, its
  strength. But (to proceed) that he thus gets in his Sting into the skin,
  I conjecture, because, when I have observ'd this creature living, I have
  found it to move the Sting thus, to and fro, and thereby also, perhaps,
  does, as 'twere, pump or force out the poisonous liquor, and make it hang
  at the end of the sheath about <i>b</i> in a drop. The crooks, I suppose
  also to be the cause why these angry creatures, hastily removing
  themselves from their revenge, do often leave these weapons behind them,
  sheath'd, as 'twere, in the flesh, and, by that means, cause the painfull
  symptoms to be greater, and more lasting, which are very probably caus'd,
  partly by the piercing and tearing of the skin by the Sting, but chiefly
  by the corrosive and poisonous liquor that is by this Syringe-pipe
  convey'd among the sensitive parts thereof and thereby more easily gnaws
  and corrodes those tender <i>fibres</i>: As
  I have shewed in the description of a Nettle and of Cowhage.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXXXV" id="obsXXXV">XXXV</a>. <i>Of the contexture and shape of the particles of
</i>Feathers<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Examining several sorts of <i>Feathers</i>, I took notice of these
  particulars in all sorts of wing-Feathers, especially in those which
  serv'd for the beating of the air in the action of flying.</p>

  <p>That the outward surface of the Quill and Stem was of a very hard,
  stiff, and horny substance, which is obvious enough, and that the part
  above the Quill was fill'd with a very white and light pith, and, with
  the <i>Microscope</i>, I found this pith to be nothing else, but a kind
  of natural <i>congeries</i> of small bubbles, the films of which seem to
  be of the same substance with that of the Quill, that is, of a stiff
  transparent horny substance.</p>

  <p>Which particular seems to me, very worthy a more serious
  consideration; For here we may observe Nature, as 'twere, put to its
  shifts, to make a substance, which shall be both light enough, and very
  stiff and strong, without varying from its own establish'd principles,
  which we may observe to be such, that very strong bodies are for the most
  part very heavie also, a strength of the parts usually requiring a
  density, and a density a gravity; and therefore should Nature have made a
  body so broad and so strong as a Feather, almost, any other way then what
  it has taken, the gravity of it must necessarily have many times exceeded
  this; for this pith seems to be like so many stops or cross pieces in a
  long optical tube, which do very much contribute to the strength of the
  whole, the pores of which were such, as that they seem'd not to have any
  communication with one another, as I have elsewhere hinted.</p>

  <p>But the Mechanism of Nature is usually so excellent, that one and the
  same substance is adapted to serve for many ends. For the chief use of
  this, indeed, seems to be for the supply of nourishment to the downy or
  feathery part of the stem; for 'tis obvious enough in all sorts of
  Feathers, that 'tis plac'd just under the roots of the branches that grow
  out of either side of the quill or stalk, and is exactly shap'd according
  to the ranking of those branches, coming no lower into the quill, then
  just the beginning of the downy branches, and growing onely on the under
  side of of the quill where those branches do so. Now, in a ripe Feather
  (as one may call it) it seems difficult to conceive how the <i>Succus
  nutritius</i> should be convey'd to this pith; for it cannot, I think, be
  well imagin'd to pass through the substance of the quill, since, having
  examin'd it with the greatest diligence I was able, I could not find the
  least appearance of pores; but he that shall well examine an unripe or
  pinn'd Feather, will plainly enough perceive the Vessel for the
  conveyance of it to be the thin filmy pith (as 'tis call'd) which passes
  through the middle of the quill.</p>

  <p>As for the make and contexture of the Down it self, it is indeed very
  rare and admirable, and such as I can
  hardly believe, that the like is to be discover'd in any other body in
  the world; for there is hardly a large Feather in the wing of a Bird, but
  contains neer a million of distinct parts, and every one of them shap'd
  in a most regular &amp; admirable form, adapted to a particular Design:
  For examining a middle ciz'd Goose-quill, I easily enough found with my
  naked eye, that the main stem of it contain'd about 300. longer and more
  Downy branchings upon one side, and as many on the other of more stiff
  but somewhat shorter branchings. Many of these long and downy branchings,
  examining with an ordinary <i>Microscope</i>, I found divers of them to
  contain neer 1200. small leaves (as I may call them, such as EF of the
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-22.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 22.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 1.
</span>
  first Figure of the 22. <i>Scheme</i>) and as many stalks on the other
  side, such as IK of the same Figure, each of the leaves or branchings,
  EF, seem'd to be divided into about sixteen or eighteen small joints, as
  may be seen plainly enough in the Figure, out of most of which there seem
  to grow small long <i>fibres</i>, such as are express'd in the Figure,
  each of them very proportionably shap'd according to its position, or
  place on the stalk EF; those on the under side of it, namely, 1, 2, 3, 4,
  5, 6, 7, 8, 9, <i>&amp;c.</i> being much longer then those directly
  opposite to them on the upper; and divers of them, such as 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
  7, 8, 9, <i>&amp;c.</i> were terminated with small crooks, much
  resembling those small crooks, which are visible enough to the naked eye,
  in the seed-buttons of Bur-docks. The stalks likewise, IK on the other
  side, seem'd divided into neer as many small knotted joints, but without
  any appearance of strings or crooks, each of them about the middle K,
  seem'd divided into two parts by a kind of fork, one side of which,
  namely, KL, was extended neer the length of KI, the other, M, was very
  short.</p>

  <p>The transverse Sections of the stems of these branchings, manifested
  the shape or figure of it to be much like INOE, which consisted of a
  horny skin or covering, and a white seemingly frothy pith, much like the
  make of the main stem of a Feather.</p>

  <p>The use of this strange kind of form, is indeed more admirable then
  all the rest, and such as deserves to be much more seriously examin'd and
  consider'd, then I have hitherto found time or ability to do; for
  certainly, it may very much instruct us in the nature of the Air,
  especially as to some properties of it.</p>

  <p>The stems of the Downy branches INOE, being rang'd in the order
  visible enough to the naked eye, at the distance of IF, or somewhat more,
  the <i>collateral</i> stalks and leaves (if I may so call those bodies I
  newly described) are so rang'd, that the leaves or hairy stalks of the
  one side lie at top, or are incumbent on the stalks of the other, and
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-22.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 22.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 2.
</span>
  cross each other, much after the manner express'd in the second Figure of
  the 22. <i>Scheme</i>, by which means every of those little hooked
  <i>fibres</i> of the leaved stalk get between the naked stalks, and the
  stalks being full of knots, and a prety way dis-join'd, so as that the
  <i>fibres</i> can easily get between them, the two parts are so closely
  and admirably woven together, that it is able to impede, for the greatest
  part, the transcursion of the Air; and though they are so exceeding
  small, as that the thickness of one of these
  stalks amounts not to a 500. part of an Inch, yet do they compose so
  strong a texture, as, notwithstanding the exceeding quick and violent
  beating of them against the Air, by the strength of the Birds wing, they
  firmly hold together. And it argues an admirable providence of Nature in
  the contrivance and fabrick of them; for their texture is such, that
  though by any external injury the parts of them are violently dis-joyn'd,
  so as that the leaves and stalks touch not one another, and consequently
  several of these rents would impede the Bird's flying; yet, for the most
  part, of themselves they readily re-join and re-contex themselves, and
  are easily by the Birds stroking the Feather, or drawing it through its
  Bill, all of them settled and woven into their former and natural
  posture; for there are such an infinite company of those small
  <i>fibres</i> in the under side of the leaves, and most of them have such
  little crooks at their ends, that they readily catch and hold the stalks
  they touch.</p>

  <p>From which strange contexture, it seems rational to suppose that there
  is a certain kind of mesh or hole so small, that the Air will not very
  easily pass through it, as I hinted also in the sixth Observation about
  small Glass Canes, for otherwise it seems probable, that Nature would
  have drawn over some kind of thin film which should have covered all
  those almost square meshes or holes, there seeming through the
  <i>Microscope</i> to be more then half of the surface of the Feather
  which is open and visibly pervious; which conjecture will yet seem more
  probable from the texture of the brushie wings of the <i>Tinea
  argentea</i>, or white Feather wing'd moth, which I shall anone describe.
  But Nature, that knows best its own laws, and the several properties of
  bodies, knows also best how to adapt and fit them to her designed ends,
  and whoso would know those properties, must endeavour to trace Nature in
  its working, and to see what course she observes. And this I suppose will
  be no inconsiderable advantage which the <i>Schematisms</i> and
  Structures of Animate bodies will afford the diligent enquirer, namely,
  most sure and excellent instructions, both as to the practical part of
  <i>Mechanicks</i> and to the <i>Theory</i> and knowledge of the nature of
  the bodies and motions.</p>

  <p>The parts of the Feathers of this glorious Bird appear, through the
  <i>Microscope</i>, no less gaudy then do the whole Feathers; for, as to
  the naked eye 'tis evident that the stem or quill of each Feather in the
  tail sends out multitudes of <i>Lateral</i> branches, such as AB in the
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-22.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 22.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 3.
</span>
  third Figure of the 22. <i>Scheme</i> represents a small part of about
  1/32 part of an Inch long, and each of the <i>lateral</i> branches emit
  multitudes of little sprigs, threads or hairs on either side of them,
  such as CD, CD, CD, so each of those threads in the <i>Microscope</i>
  appears a large long body, consisting of a multitude
  of bright reflecting parts, whose Figure 'tis no easie matter to
  determine, as he that examines it shall find; for every new position of
  it to the light makes it perfectly seem of another form and shape, and
  nothing what it appear'd a little before; nay, it appear'd very differing
  ofttimes from so seemingly inconsiderable a circumstance, that the
  interposing of ones hand between the light and it, makes a very great
  change, and the opening or shutting a Casement and the like, very much
  diversifies the appearance. And though, by examining the form of it very
  many ways, which would be tedious here to enumerate, I suppose I have
  discover'd the true Figure of it, yet oftentimes, upon looking on it in
  another posture, I have almost thought my former observations deficient,
  though indeed, upon further examination, I have found even those also to
  confirm them.</p>

  <p>These threads therefore I find to be a <i>congeries</i> of small
  <i>Laminæ</i> or plates, as <i>eeeee</i>, &amp;c. each of them shap'd
  much like this of <i>abcd</i>, in the fourth <i>Figure</i>, the part
  <i>ac</i> being a ridge, prominency, or stem, and <i>b</i> and <i>d</i>
  the corners of two small thin Plates that grow unto the small stalk in
  the middle, so that they make a kind of little feather; each of these
  Plates lie one close to another, almost like a company of sloping ridge
  or gutter Tyles; they grow on each side of the stalk opposite to one
  another, by two and two, from top to bottom, in the manner express'd in
  the fifth Figure, the tops of the lower covering the roots of the next
  above them; the under side of each of these laminated bodies, is of a
  very dark and opacous substance, and suffers very few Rays to be
  trajected, but reflects them all toward that side from whence they come,
  much like the foil of a Looking-glass; but their upper sides seem to me
  to consist of a multitude of thin plated bodies, which are exceeding
  thin, and lie very close together, and thereby, like mother of Pearl
  shells, do not onely reflect a very brisk light, but tinge that light in
  a most curious manner; and by means of various positions, in respect of
  the light, they reflect back now one colour, and then another, and those
  most vividly.</p>

  <p>Now, that these colours are onely <i>fantastical</i> ones, that is,
  such as arise immediately from the refractions of the light, I found by
  this, that water wetting these colour'd parts, destroy'd their colours,
  which seem'd to proceed from the alteration of the reflection and
  refraction. Now, though I was not able to see those hairs at all
  transparent by a common light, yet by looking on them against the Sun, I
  found them to be ting'd with a darkish red colour, nothing a-kin to the
  curious and lovely greens and blues they exhibited.</p>

  <p>What the reason of colour seems to be in such thin plated bodies, I
  have elsewhere shewn. But how water cast upon those threads destroys
  their colours, I suppose to be perform'd thus; The water falling upon
  these plated bodies from its having a greater congruity to Feathers then
  the Air, insinuates it self between those Plates, and so extrudes the
  strong reflecting Air, whence both these parts grow more transparent, as
  the <i>Microscope</i> informs, and colourless also, at best retaining a
  very faint and dull colour. But this wet being wasted away
  by the continual evaporations and steams that pass through them from the
  Peacock, whil'st that Bird is yet alive, the colours again appear in
  their former luster, the <i>interstitia</i> of these Plates being fill'd
  with the strongly reflecting Air.</p>

  <p>The beauteous and vivid colours of the Feathers of this Bird, being
  found to proceed from the curious and exceeding smalness and fineness of
  the reflecting parts, we have here the reason given us of all those
  gauderies in the apparel of other Birds also, and how they come to exceed
  the colours of all other kinds of Animals, besides Insects; for since (as
  we here, and elsewhere also shew) the vividness of a colour, depends upon
  the fineness and transparency of the reflecting and refracting parts; and
  since our <i>Microscope</i> discovers to us, that the component parts of
  feathers are such, and that the hairs of Animals are otherwise; and since
  we find also by the Experiment of that Noble and most Excellent Person I
  formerly named; that the difference between Silk and Flax, as to its
  colour, is nothing else (for Flax reduc'd to a very great fineness of
  parts, both white and colour'd, appears as white and as vivid as any
  Silk, but loses that brightness and its Silken aspect as soon as it is
  twisted into thread, by reason that the component parts, though very
  small and fine, are yet pliable flakes, and not cylinders, and thence, by
  twisting, become united into one opacous body, whereas the threads of
  Silk and Feathers retain their lustre, by preserving their cylindrical
  form intire without mixing; so that each reflected and refracted beam
  that composes the gloss of Silk, preserves its own property of modulating
  the light intire); And since we find the same confirm'd by many other
  Experiments elsewhere mentioned, I think we may safely conclude this for
  an Axiome, that wheresoever we meet with transparent bodies, spun out
  into very fine parts, either cleer, or any ways ting'd, the colours
  resulting from such a <i>composition</i> must necessarily be very
  glorious, vivid, and cleer, like those of Silk and Feathers. This may
  perhaps hint some usefull way of making other bodies, besides Silk, be
  susceptible of bright tinctures, but of this onely by the by.</p>

  <p>The changeable colour'd Feathers also of Ducks, and several other
  Birds, I have found by examination with my <i>Microscope</i>, to proceed
  from much the same causes and textures.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXXXVII" id="obsXXXVII">XXXVII</a>. <i>Of the Feet of </i>Flies<i>, and several other </i>Insects<i>.</i></h3>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-23.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 23.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 1, 2.
</span>
  <p>The foot of a Fly (delineated in the first <i>Figure</i> of the 23.
  <i>Scheme</i>, which represents three joints, the two Tallons, and the
  two Pattens in a flat posture; and in the second <i>Figure</i> of the
  same <i>Scheme</i>, which represents onely one joint, the Tallons and
  Pattens in another posture) is of a most admirable and curious
  contrivance, for by this the Flies are inabled to walk against the sides
  of Glass, perpendicularly upwards, and to contain
  themselves in that posture as long as they please; nay, to walk and
  suspend themselves against the under surface of many bodies, as the
  ceiling of a room, or the like, and this with as great a seeming facility
  and firmness, as if they were a kind of <i>Antipodes</i>, and had a
  <i>tendency</i> upwards, as we are sure they have the contrary, which
  they also evidently discover, in that they cannot make themselves so
  light, as to stick or suspend themselves on the under surface of a Glass
  well polish'd and cleans'd; their suspension therefore is wholly to be
  ascrib'd to some Mechanical contrivance in their feet; which, what it is,
  we shall in brief explain, by shewing, that its Mechanism consists
  principally in two parts, that is, first its two Claws, or Tallons, and
  secondly, two Palms, Pattens, or Soles.</p>

  <p>The two Tallons are very large, in proportion to the foot, and
  handsomly shap'd in the manner describ'd in the <i>Figures</i>, by AB,
  and AC, the bigger part of them from A to <i>dd</i>, is all hairy, or
  brisled, but toward the top, at C and B smooth, the tops or points, which
  seem very sharp turning downwards and inwards, are each of them mov'd on
  a joint at A, by which the Fly is able to open or shut them at pleasure,
  so that the points B and C being entered in any pores, and the Fly
  endeavouring to shut them, the Claws not onely draw one against another,
  and so fasten each other, but they draw the whole foot, GGADD forward, so
  that on a soft footing, the tenters or points GGGG, (whereof a Fly has
  about ten in each foot, to wit, two in every joint) run into the pores,
  if they find any, or at least make their way; and this is sensible to the
  naked eye, in the feet of a <i>Chafer</i>, which, if he be suffer'd to
  creep over the hand, or any other part of the skin of ones body, does
  make his steps as sensible to the touch as the sight.</p>

  <p>But this contrivance, as it often fails the <i>Chafer</i>, when he
  walks on hard and close bodies, so would it also our Fly, though he be a
  much lesser, and nimbler creature, and therefore Nature has furnish'd his
  foot with another <i>additament</i> much more curious and admirable, and
  that is, with a couple of Palms, Pattens or Soles DD, the structure of
  which is this:</p>

  <p>From the bottom or under part of the last joint of his foot, K, arise
  two small thin plated horny substances, each consisting of two flat
  pieces, DD, which seem to be flexible, like the covers of a Book, about
  FF, by which means, the plains of the two sides EE, do not always lie in
  the same plain, but may be sometimes shut closer, and so each of them may
  take a little hold themselves on a body; but that is not all, for the
  under sides of these Soles are all beset with small brisles, or tenters,
  like the Wire teeth of a Card used for working Wool, the points of all
  which tend forwards, hence the two Tallons drawing the feet forwards, as
  I before hinted, and these being applied to the surface of the body with
  all the points looking the contrary way, that is, forwards and outwards,
  if there be any irregularity or yielding in the surface of the body, the
  Fly suspends it self very firmly and easily, without the access or need
  of any such Sponges fill'd with an imaginary <i>gluten</i>, as many have,
  for want of good Glasses, perhaps, or a troublesome and diligent
  examination, suppos'd.</p>

  <p>Now, that the Fly is able to walk on Glass, proceeds partly from some
  ruggedness of the surface: and chiefly from
  a kind of tarnish, or dirty smoaky substance, which adheres to the
  surface of that very hard body; and though the pointed parts cannot
  penetrate the substance of Glass, yet may they find pores enough in the
  tarnish, or at least make them.</p>

  <p>This Structure I somewhat the more diligently survey'd, because I
  could not well comprehend, how, if there were such a glutinous matter in
  those supposed Sponges, as most (that have observ'd that Object in a
  <i>Microscope</i>) have hitherto believ'd, how, I say, the Fly could so
  readily unglew and loosen its feet: and, because I have not found any
  other creature to have a contrivance any ways like it, and chiefly, that
  we might not be cast upon unintelligible explications of the
  <i>Phænomena</i> of Nature, at least others then the true ones, where our
  senses were able to furnish us with an intelligible, rationall and true
  one.</p>

  <p>Somewhat a like contrivance to this of Flies shall we find in most
  other Animals, such as all kinds of Flies and case-wing'd creatures; nay,
  in a Flea, an Animal abundantly smaller then this Fly. Other creatures,
  as Mites, the Land-Crab, <i>&amp;c.</i> have onely one small very sharp
  Tallon at the end of each of their legs, which all drawing towards the
  center or middle of their body, inable these exceeding light bodies to
  suspend and fasten themselves to almost any surface.</p>

  <p>Which how they are able to do, will not seem strange, if we consider,
  first, how little body there is in one of these creatures compar'd to
  their superficies, or outside, their thickness, perhaps, oftentimes, not
  amounting to the hundredth part of an Inch: Next, the strength and
  agility of these creatures compar'd to their bulk, being, proportionable
  to their bulk, perhaps, an hundred times stronger then an Horse or Man.
  And thirdly, if we consider that Nature does always appropriate the
  instruments, so as they are the most fit and convenient to perform their
  offices, and the most simple and plain that possibly can be; this we may
  see further verify'd also in the foot of a Louse which is very much
  differing from those I have been describing, but more convenient and
  necessary for the place of its habitation, each of his leggs being footed
  with a couple of small claws which he can open or shut at pleasure,
  shap'd almost like the claws of a Lobster or Crab, but with appropriated
  contrivances for his peculiar life, which being to move its body to and
  fro upon the hairs of the creature it inhabits, Nature has furnish'd one
  of its claws with joints, almost like the joints of a man's fingers, so
  as thereby it is able to encompass or grasp a hair as firmly as a man can
  a stick or rope.</p>

  <p>Nor, is there a less admirable and wonderfull <i>Mechanism</i> in the
  foot of a Spider, whereby he is able to spin, weave, and climb, or run on
  his curious transparent clew, of which I shall say more in the
  description of that Animal.</p>

  <p>And to conclude, we shall in all things find, that Nature does not
  onely work Mechanically, but by such excellent and most compendious, as
  well as stupendious contrivances, that it were impossible for all the
  reason in the world to find out any contrivance to do the same thing that
  should have more convenient properties. And can any be so sottish,
  as to think all those things the
  productions of chance? Certainly, either their Ratiocination must be
  extremely depraved, or they did never attentively consider and
  contemplate the Works of the Al-mighty.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXXXVIII" id="obsXXXVIII">XXXVIII</a>. <i>Of the Structure and motion of the Wings
of </i>Flies<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>The Wings of all kinds of Insects, are, for the most part, very
  beautifull Objects, and afford no less pleasing an Object to the mind to
  speculate upon, then to the eye to behold. This of the blue Fly, among
  the rest, wants not its peculiar ornaments and contrivances; it grows out
  of the <i>Thorax</i>, or middle part of the body of a Fly, and is seated
  a little beyond the center of gravity in the body towards the head, but
  that <i>Excentricly</i> is curiously balanc'd; first, by the expanded
  <i>Area</i> of the wings which lies all more backwards then the root, by
  the motion of them, whereby the center of their vibration is much more
  backwards towards the tail of the Fly then the root of the wing is. What
  the vibrative motion of the wings is, and after what manner they are
  moved, I have endeavoured by many trials to find out: And first for the
  manner of their motion, I endeavoured to observe several of those kind of
  small Spinning Flies, which will naturally suspend themselves, as it
  were, pois'd and steady in one place of the air, without rising or
  falling, or moving forwards or backwards; for by looking down on those, I
  could by a kind of faint shadow, perceive the utmost extremes of the
  vibrative motion of their wings, which shadow, whil'st they so
  endeavoured to suspend themselves, was not very long, but when they
  endeavour'd to flie forwards, it was somewhat longer; next, I tried it,
  by fixing the leggs of a Fly upon the top of the stalk of a feather, with
  Glew, Wax, <i>&amp;c.</i> and then making it endeavour to flie away; for
  being thereby able to view it in any posture, I collected that the motion
  of the wing was after this manner. The extreme limits of the vibrations
  were usually somewhat about the length of the body distant from one
  another, oftentimes shorter, and sometimes also longer; that the formost
  limit was usually a little above the back, and the hinder somwhat beneath
  the belly; between which two limits, if one may ghess by the sound, the
  wing seem'd to be mov'd forwards and backwards with an equal velocity:
  And if one may (from the shadow or faint representation the wings
  afforded, and from the consideration of the nature of the thing) ghess at
  the posture or manner of the wings moving between them, it seem'd to be
  this: The wing being suppos'd placed in the upmost limit, seems to be put
  so that the plain of it lies almost <i>horizontal</i>, but onely the
  forepart does dip a little, or is somewhat more deprest; in this position
  is the wing vibrated or mov'd to the lower limit, being almost arrived at
  the lower limit, the hinder part of the wing moving somewhat faster then
  the former, the <i>Area</i>, of the wing begins
  to dip behind, and in that posture seems it to be mov'd to the upper
  limit back again, and thence back again in the first posture, the former
  part of the <i>Area</i> dipping again, as it is moved downwards by means
  of the quicker motion of the main stem which terminates or edges the
  forepart of the wing. And these vibrations or motions to and fro between
  the two limits seem so swift, that 'tis very probable (from the sound it
  affords, if it be compar'd with the vibration of a musical string, tun'd
  unison to it) it makes many hundreds, if not some thousands of vibrations
  in a second minute of time. And, if we may be allow'd to ghess by the
  sound, the wing of a Bee is yet more swift, for the tone is much more
  acute, and that, in all likelihood, proceeds from the exceeding swift
  beating of the air by the small wing. And it seems the more likely too,
  because the wing of a Bee is less in proportion to its body, then the
  other wing to the body of a Fly; so that for ought I know, it may be one
  of the quickest vibrating <i>spontaneous</i> motions of any in the world;
  and though perhaps there may be many Flies in other places that afford a
  yet more shrill note with their wings, yet 'tis most probable that the
  quickest vibrating <i>spontaneous</i> motion is to be found in the wing
  of some creature. Now, if we consider the exceeding quickness of these
  Animal spirits that must cause these motions, we cannot chuse but admire
  the exceeding vividness of the governing faculty or <i>Anima</i> of the
  Insect, which is able to dispose and regulate so the the motive
  faculties, as to cause every peculiar organ, not onely to move or act so
  quick, but to do it also so regularly.</p>

  <p>Whil'st I was examining and considering the curious <i>Mechanism</i>
  of the wings, I observ'd that under the wings of most kind of Flies,
  Bees, <i>&amp;c.</i> there were plac'd certain <i>pendulums</i> or
  extended drops (as I may so call them from their resembling motion and
  figure) for they much resembled a long hanging drop of some transparent
  viscous liquor; and I observed them constantly to move just before the
  wings of the Fly began to move, so that at the first sight I could not
  but ghess, that there was some excellent use, as to the regulation of the
  motion of the wing, and did phancy, that it might be something like the
  handle of a Cock, which by vibrating to and fro, might, as 'twere, open
  and shut the Cock, and thereby give a passage to the determinate
  influences into the Muscles; afterwards, upon some other trials, I
  suppos'd that they might be for some use in respiration, which for many
  reasons I suppose those Animals to use, and, me thought, it was not very
  improbable, but that they might have convenient passages under the wings
  for the emitting, at least, of the air, if not admitting, as in the gills
  of Fishes is most evident; or, perhaps, this <i>Pendulum</i> might be
  somewhat like the staff to a Pump, whereby these creatures might exercise
  their <i>Analogous</i> lungs, and not only draw in, but force out, the
  air they live by: but these were but conjectures, and upon further
  examination seem'd less probable.</p>

</span>
  <p>The fabrick of the wing, as it appears through a moderately magnifying
  <i>Microscope</i>, seems to be a body consisting of two parts, as is
  visible in the 4. <i>Figure</i> of the 23. <i>Scheme</i>; and by the 2.
  <i>Figure</i> of the 26. <i>Scheme</i>; the one is a quilly
  or finny substance, consisting of several long, slender and variously
  bended quills or wires, something resembling the veins of leaves; these
  are, as 'twere, the finns or quills which stiffen the whole <i>Area</i>,
  and keep the other part distended, which is a very thin transparent skin
  or membrane variously folded, and platted, but not very regularly, and is
  besides exceeding thickly bestuck with innumerable small bristles, which
  are onely perceptible by the bigger magnifying <i>Microscope</i>, and not
  with that neither, but with a very convenient augmentation of sky-light
  projected on the Object with a burning Glass, as I have elsewhere shew'd,
  or by looking through it against the light.</p>

  <p>In steed of these small hairs, in several other Flies, there are
  infinite of small Feathers, which cover both the under and upper sides of
  this thin film as in almost all the sorts of Butterflies and Moths: and
  those small parts are not onely shap'd very much like the feathers of
  Birds, but like those variegated with all the variety of curious bright
  and vivid colours imaginable; and those feathers are likewise so
  admirably and delicately rang'd, as to compose very fine flourishings and
  ornamental paintings, like <i>Turkie</i> and <i>Persian</i> Carpets, but
  of far more surpassing beauty, as is evident enough to the naked eye, in
  the painted wings of Butterflies, but much more through an ordinary
  <i>Microscope</i>.</p>

  <p>Intermingled likewise with these hairs, may be perceived multitudes of
  little pits, or black spots, in the exended membrane, which seem to be
  the root of the hairs that grow on the other side; these two bodies seem
  dispers'd over the whole surface of the wing.</p>

  <p>The hairs are best perceiv'd, by looking through it against the light,
  or, by laying the wing upon a very white piece of Paper, in a convenient
  light, for thereby every little hair most manifestly appears; a

  <i>Specimen</i> of which you may observe drawn in the fourth
  <i>Figure</i> of the 23. <i>Scheme</i>, AB, CD, EF whereof represent some
  parts of the bones or quills of the wing, each of which you may perceive
  to be cover'd over with a multitude of scales, or bristles, the former
  AB, is the biggest stem of all the wing, and may be properly enough
  call'd the cut-air, it being that which terminates and stiffens the
  formost edge of the wing; the fore-edge of this is arm'd with a multitude
  of little brisles, or Tenter-hooks, in some standing regular and in
  order, in others not; all the points of which are directed from the body
  towards the tip of the wing, nor is this edge onely thus fring'd, but
  even all the whole edge of the wing is covered with a small fringe,
  consisting of short and more slender brisles.</p>

  <p>This Subject, had I time, would afford excellent matter for the
  contemplation of the nature of wings and of flying, but, because I may,
  perhaps, get a more convenient time to prosecute that speculation, and
  recollect several Observations that I have made of that particular. I
  shall at present proceed to</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXXXIX" id="obsXXXIX">XXXIX</a>. <i>Of the Eyes and Head of a </i>Grey drone-Fly<i>,
and of several other creatures.</i></h3>

  <p>I took a large grey <i>Drone-Fly</i>, that had a large head, but a
  small and slender body in proportion to it, and cutting off its head, I
  fix'd it with the forepart or face upwards upon my Object Plate (this I
  made choice of rather then the head of a great blue Fly, because my
  enquiry being now about the eyes, I found this Fly to have, first the
  biggest clusters of eyes in proportion to his head, of any small kind of
  Fly that I have yet seen, it being somewhat inclining towards the make of
  the large <i>Dragon-Flies</i>. Next, because there is a greater variety
  in the knobs or balls of each cluster, then is of any small Fly.) Then
  examining it according to my usual manner, by varying the degrees of
  light, and altering its position to each kinde of light, I drew that
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-24.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 24.</a>
</span>
  representation of it which is delineated in the 24. <i>Scheme</i>, and
  found these things to be as plain and evident, as notable and
  pleasant.</p>

  <p><i>First</i>, that the greatest part of the face, nay, of the head,
  was nothing else but two large and <i>protuberant</i> bunches, or
  <i>prominent</i> parts, ABCDEA, the surface of each of which was all
  cover'd over, or shap'd into a multitude of small <i>Hemispheres</i>,
  plac'd in a <i>triagonal</i> order, that being the closest and most
  compacted, and in that order, rang'd over the whole surface of the eye in
  very lovely rows, between each of which, as is necessary, were left long
  and regular trenches, the bottoms of every of which, were perfectly
  intire and not at all perforated or drill'd through, which I most
  certainly was assured of, by the regularly reflected Image of certain
  Objects which I mov'd to and fro between the head and the light. And by
  examining the <i>Cornea</i> or outward skin, after I had stript it off
  from the several substances that lay within it, and by looking both upon
  the inside and against the light.</p>

  <p><i>Next</i>, that of those multitudes of <i>Hemispheres</i>, there
  were observable two degrees of bigness, the half of them that were
  lowermost, and look'd toward the ground or their own leggs, namely, CDE,
  CDE being a pretty deal smaller then the other, namely, ABCE, ABCE, that
  look'd upward, and side-ways, or foreright, and backward, which variety I
  have not found in any other small Fly.</p>

  <p><i>Thirdly</i>, that every one of these <i>Hemispheres</i>, as they
  seem'd to be pretty neer the true shape of a <i>Hemisphere</i>, so was
  the surface exceeding smooth and regular, reflecting as exact, regular,
  and perfect an Image of any Object from the surface of them, as a small
  Ball of Quick-silver of that bigness would do, but nothing neer so vivid,
  the reflection from these being very languid, much like the reflection
  from the outside of Water, Glass, Crystal, <i>&amp;c.</i> In so much that
  in each of these <i>Hemispheres</i>, I have been able to discover a
  Land-scape of those things which lay before my window,
  one thing of which was a large Tree, whose trunk and top I could plainly
  discover, as I could also the parts of my window, and my hand and
  fingers, if I held it between the Window and the Object; a small draught
  of nineteen of which, as they appear'd in the bigger Magnifying-glass to
  reflect the Image of the two windows of my Chamber, are delineated in the
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-23.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 23.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 3.
</span>
  third <i>Figure</i> of the 23. <i>Scheme</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Fourthly</i>, that these rows were so dispos'd, that there was no
  quarter visible from his head that there was not some of these
  <i>Hemispheres</i> directed against, so that a Fly may be truly said to
  have <i>an eye every way</i>, and to be really <i>circumspect</i>. And it
  was further observable, that that way where the trunk of his body did
  hinder his prospect backward, these <i>protuberances</i> were elevated,
  as it were, above the plain of his shoulders and back, so that he was
  able to see backwards also over his back.</p>

  <p><i>Fifthly</i>, in living Flies, I have observ'd, that when any small
  mote or dust, which flies up and down the air, chances to light upon any
  part of these knobs, as it is sure to stick firmly to it and not fall,
  though through the <i>Microscope</i> it appears like a large stone or
  stick (which one would admire, especially since it is no ways probable
  that there is any wet or glutinous matter upon these <i>Hemispheres</i>,
  but I hope I shall render the reason in another place) so the Fly
  presently makes use of his two fore-feet in stead of eye-lids, with
  which, as with two Brooms or Brushes, they being all bestuck with
  Brisles, he often sweeps or brushes off what ever hinders the prospect of
  any of his <i>Hemispheres</i>, and then, to free his leggs from that
  dirt, he rubs them one against another, the pointed Brisles or Tenters of
  which looking both one way, the rubbing of them to and fro one against
  another, does cleanse them in the same manner as I have observ'd those
  that Card Wool, to cleanse their Cards, by placing their Cards, so as the
  teeth of both look the same way, and then rubbing them one against
  another. In the very same manner do they brush and cleanse their bodies
  and wings, as I shall by and by shew; other creatures have other
  contrivances for the cleansing and cleering their eyes.</p>

  <p><i>Sixthly</i> that the number of the <i>Pearls</i> or
  <i>Hemispheres</i> in the clusters of this Fly, was neer 14000. which I
  judged by numbering certain rows of them several ways, and casting up the
  whole content, accounting each cluster to contain about seven thousand
  Pearls, three thousand of which were of a size, and consequently the rows
  not so thick, and the foure thousand I accounted to be the number of the
  smaller Pearls next the feet and <i>proboscis</i>. Other Animals I
  observ'd to have yet a greater number, as the <i>Dragon-Fly</i> or
  <i>Adderbolt</i>: And others to have a much less company, as an
  <i>Ant</i>, &amp;c. and several other small Flies and Insects.</p>

  <p><i>Seventhly</i>, that the order of these eies or <i>Hemispheres</i>
  was altogether curious and admirable, they being plac'd in all kind of
  Flies, and <i>aerial</i> animals, in a most curious and regular
  ordination of triangular rows, in which order they are rang'd the neerest
  together that possibly they can, and consequently leave the least pits or
  trenches between them. But in <i>Shrimps</i>, <i>Crawfishes</i>,
  <i>Lobsters</i>, and such kinds of <i>Crustaceous</i> water Animals, I
  have yet observ'd them rang'd in a quadrangular
  order, the rows cutting each other at right angles, which as it admits of
  a less number of Pearls in equal surfaces; so have those creatures a
  recompence made them, by having their eyes a little movable in their
  heads, which the other altogether want. So infinitely wise and provident
  do we find all the Dispensations in Nature, that certainly
  <i>Epicurus</i>, and his followers, must very little have consider'd
  them, who ascrib'd those things to the production of chance, that wil, to
  a more attentive considerer, appear the products of the highest Wisdom
  and Providence.</p>

  <p>Upon the Anatomy or Dissection of the Head, I observ'd these
  particulars:</p>

  <p>First, that this outward skin, like the <i>Cornea</i> of the eyes of
  the greater Animals, was both flexible and transparent, and seem'd,
  through the <i>Microscope</i> perfectly to resemble the very substance of
  the <i>Cornea</i> of a man's eye; for having cut out the cluster, and
  remov'd the dark and <i>mucous</i> stuff that is subjacent to it, I could
  see it transparent like a thin piece of skin, having as many cavities in
  the inside of it, and rang'd in the same order as it had
  <i>protuberances</i> on the outside, and this propriety, I found the same
  in all the Animals that had it, whether Flies or Shell-Fish.</p>

  <p>Secondly, I found that all Animals that I have observ'd with those
  kind of eyes; have within this <i>Cornea</i>, a certain cleer liquor or
  juice, though in a very little quantity, and,</p>

  <p>I observ'd thirdly, that within that cleer liquor, they had a kind of
  dark <i>mucous</i> lining, which was all spread round within the cavity
  of the clutter, and seem'd very neer adjoining to it, the colour of
  which, in some Flies, was grey; in others, black, in others red; in
  others, of a mix'd colour; in others, spotted; and that the whole
  clusters, when look'd on whilst the Animal was living, or but newly
  kill'd, appear'd of the same colour that this coat (as I may so call it)
  appear'd of, when that outward skin, or <i>Cornea</i>, was remov'd.</p>

  <p>Fourthly, that the rest of the capacity of the clusters was in some,
  as in Dragon Flies, <i>&amp;c.</i> hollow, or empty; in others fill'd
  with some kind of substance; in blue Flies, with a reddish musculous
  substance, with <i>fibres</i> tending from the center or bottom outwards;
  and divers other, with various and differing kinds of substances.</p>

  <p>That this curious contrivance is the organ of sight to all those
  various <i>Crustaceous</i> Animals, which are furnish'd with it, I think
  we need not doubt, if we consider but the several congruities it has with
  the eyes of greater creatures.</p>

  <p>As first, that it is furnish'd with a <i>Cornea</i>, with a
  <i>transparent humour</i>, and with a <i>uvea</i> or <i>retina</i>, that
  the Figure of each of the small <i>Hemispheres</i> are very
  <i>Spherical</i>, exactly polish'd, and most vivid, lively and plump,
  when the Animal is living, as in greater Animals, and in like manner
  dull, flaccid, and irregular, or shrunk, when the Animal is dead.</p>

  <p>Next, that those creatures that are furnish'd with it, have no other
  organs that have any resemblance to the known eyes of other
  creatures.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, that those which they call the eyes of Crabs, Lobsters,
  Shrimps, and the like, and are really so, are <i>Hemispher'd</i>, almost
  in the same manner as these of Flies are. And that they really are so, I
  have very often try'd, by cutting off these little movable knobs, and
  putting the creature again into the water, that it would swim to and fro,
  and move up and down as well as before, but would often hit it self
  against the rocks or stones; and though I put my hand just before its
  head, it would not at all start or fly back till I touch'd it, whereas
  whil'st those were remaining, it would start back, and avoid my hand or a
  stick at a good distance before it touch'd it. And if in
  <i>crustaceous</i> Sea-animals, then it seems very probable also, that
  these knobs are the eyes in <i>crustaceous</i> Insects, which are also of
  the same kind, onely in a higher and more active Element; this the
  conformity or congruity of many other parts common to either of them,
  will strongly argue, their <i>crustaceous</i> armour, their number of
  leggs, which are six, beside the two great claws, which answer to the
  wings in Insects; and in all kind of Spiders, as also in many other
  Insects that want wings, we shall find the compleat number of them, and
  not onely the number, but the very shape, figure, joints, and claws of
  Lobsters and Crabs, as is evident in Scorpions and Spiders, as is visible

  in the second <i>Figure</i> of the 31. <i>Scheme</i>, and in the little
  Mite-worm, which I call a Land-crab, describ'd in the second Figure of
  the 33. <i>Scheme</i>, but in their manner of generation being oviparous,
  <i>&amp;c.</i> And it were very worthy observation, whether there be not
  some kinds of transformation and metamorphosis in the several states of
  <i>crustaceous</i> water-animals, as there is in several sorts of
  Insects; for if such could be met with, the progress of the variations
  would be much more conspicuous in those larger Animals, then they can be
  in any kind of Insects our colder Climate affords.</p>

  <p>These being their eyes, it affords us a very pretty Speculation to
  contemplate their manner of vision, which, as it is very differing from
  that of <i>biocular</i> Animals, so is it not less admirable.</p>

  <p>That each of these Pearls or <i>Hemispheres</i> is a perfect eye, I
  think we need not doubt, if we consider onely the outside or figure of
  any one of them, for they being each of them cover'd with a transparent
  protuberant <i>Cornea</i>, and containing a liquor within them,
  resembling the watry or glassie humours of the eye, must necessarily
  refract all the parallel Rays that fall on them out of the air, into a
  point not farr distant within them, where (in all probability) the
  <i>Retina</i> of the eye is placed, and that opacous, dark, and mucous
  inward coat that (I formerly shew'd) I found to subtend the concave part
  of the cluster is very likely to be that <i>tunicle</i> or coat, it
  appearing through the <i>Microscope</i> to be plac'd a little more than a
  Diameter of those Pearls below or within the <i>tunica cornea</i>. And if
  so, then is there in all probability, a little Picture or Image of the
  objects without, painted or made at the bottom of the <i>Retina</i>
  against every one of those Pearls, so that there are as many impressions
  on the <i>Retina</i> or opacous skin, as there are Pearls or
  <i>Hemispheres</i> on the cluster. But because it is impossible for any
  protuberant surface whatsoever, whether <i>sphærial</i> or other, so to
  refract the Rays that come from farr remote   <i>lateral</i> points of any Object as to collect them again, and unite
  them each in a distinct point, and that onely those Rays which come from
  some point that lies in the <i>Axis</i> of the Figure produc'd, are so
  accurately refracted to one and the same point again, and that the
  <i>lateral</i> Rays, the further they are remov'd, the more imperfect is
  their refracted confluence; It follows therefore, that onely the Picture
  of those parts of the external objects that lie in, or neer, the
  <i>Axis</i> of each <i>Hemisphere</i>, are discernably painted or made on
  the <i>Retina</i> of each <i>Hemisphere</i>, and that therefore each of
  them can distinctly sensate or see onely those parts which are very neer
  perpendicularly oppos'd to it, or lie in or neer its optick <i>Axis</i>.
  Now, though there may be by each of these eye-pearls, a representation to
  the Animal of a whole <i>Hemisphere</i> in the same manner as in a man's
  eye there is a picture or sensation in the <i>Retina</i> of all the
  objects lying almost in an <i>Hemisphere</i>; yet, as in a man's eye
  also, there are but some very few points which liyng in, or neer, the
  optick <i>Axis</i> are distinctly discern'd: So there may be multitudes
  of Pictures made of an Object in the several Pearls, and yet but one, or
  some very few that are distinct; The representation of any object that is
  made in any other Pearl, but that which is directly, or very neer
  directly, oppos'd, being altogether confus'd and unable to produce a
  distinct vision.</p>

  <p>So that we see, that though it has pleas'd the All-wise Creator, to
  indue this creature with such multitudes of eyes, yet has he not indued
  it with the faculty of seeing more then another creature; for whereas
  this cannot move his head, at least can move it very little, without
  moving his whole body, <i>biocular</i> creatures can in an instant (or
  <i>the twinkling of an eye</i>, which, being very quick, is vulgarly used
  in the same signification) move their eyes so as to direct the optick
  <i>Axis</i> to any point; nor is it probable, that they are able to see
  attentively at one time more then one Physical point; for though there be
  a distinct Image made in every eye, yet 'tis very likely, that the
  observing faculty is only imploy'd about some one object for which they
  have most concern.</p>

  <p>Now, as we accurately distinguish the site or position of an Object by
  the motion of the Muscles of the eye requisite to put the optick Line in
  a direct position, and confusedly by the position of the imperfect
  Picture of the object at the bottom of the eye; so are these
  <i>crustaceous</i> creatures able to judge confusedly of the position of
  objects by the Picture or impression made at the bottom of the opposite
  Pearl, and distinctly by the removal of the attentive or observing
  faculty, from one Pearl to another, but what this faculty is, as it
  requires another place, so a much deeper speculation. Now, because it
  were impossible, even with this multitude of eye-balls, to see any object
  distinct (for as I hinted before, onely those parts that lay in, or very
  neer, the optick Lines could be so) the Infinitely wise Creator has not
  left the creature without a power of moving the head a little in
  <i>Aerial crustaceous</i> animals, and the very eyes also in
  <i>crustaceous</i> Sea-animals; so that by these means they are inabled
  to direct some optick line or other against any object, and by that means
  they have the visive faculty as compleat as any Animal that can move its
  eyes.</p>

  <p>Distances of Objects also, 'tis very likely they distinguish, partly
  by the consonant impressions made in some two convenient Pearls, one in
  each cluster; for, according as those congruous impressions affect, two
  Pearls neerer approach'd to each other, the neerer is the Object, and the
  farther they are distant, the more distant is the Object: partly also by
  the alteration of each Pearl, requisite to make the Sensation or Picture
  perfect; for 'tis impossible that the Pictures of two Objects, variously
  distant, can be perfectly painted, or made on the same <i>Retina</i> or
  bottom of the eye not altered, as will be very evident to any one that
  shall attentively consider the nature of refraction. Now, whether this
  alteration may be in the Figure of the <i>Cornea</i>, in the motion of
  access or recess of the <i>Retina</i> towards the <i>Cornea</i>, or in
  the alteration of a crustaline humour, if such there be, I pretend not to
  determine; though I think we need not doubt, but that there may be as
  much curiosity of contrivance and structure in every one of these Pearls,
  as in the eye of a Whale or Elephant, and the almighty's <i>Fiat</i>
  could as easily cause the existence of the one as the other; and as one
  day and a thousand years are the same with him, so may one eye and ten
  thousand.</p>

  <p>This we may be sure of, that the filaments or sensative parts of the
  <i>Retina</i> must be most exceedingly curious and minute, since the
  whole Picture it self is such; what must needs the component parts be of
  that <i>Retina</i>, which distinguishes the part of an object's Picture
  that must be many millions of millions less then that in a man's eye? And
  how exceeding curious and subtile must the component parts of the
  <i>medium</i> that conveys light be, when we find the instrument made for
  its reception or refraction to be so exceedingly small? we may, I think,
  from this speculation be sufficiently discouraged from hoping to discover
  by any optick or other instrument the determinate bulk of the parts of
  the <i>medium</i> that conveys the pulse of light, since we find that
  there is not less accurateness shewn in the Figure and polish of those
  exceedingly minute lenticular surfaces, then in those more large and
  conspicuous surfaces of our own eyes. And yet can I not doubt, but that
  there is a determinate bulk of those parts, since I find them unable to
  enter between the parts of Mercury, which being in motion, must
  necessarily have pores, as I shall elsewhere shew, and here pass by, as
  being a digression.</p>

  <p>As concerning the horns FF, the feelers or smellers, GG, the
  <i>Probascis</i> HH, and I, the hairs and brisles, KK, I shall indeavour
  to describe in the 42. <i>Observation</i>.</p>

  of it, which is represented in the first <i>Figure</i> of the 25.
  <i>Scheme</i>, save that his bended body, ABCDEF, which seem'd fashioned
  very much like a row of small teeth, orderly plac'd in the Gums, and
  looks as if it were divided into several smaller and
  greater black teeth, was nothing but one small bended hard bone, which
  was plac'd in the upper jaw of the mouth of a House-Snail, with which I
  observ'd this very Snail to feed on the leaves of a Rose-tree, and to
  bite out pretty large and half round bits, not unlike the Figure of a (C)
  nor very much differing from it in bigness, the upper part ABCD of this
  bone, I found to be much whiter, and to grow out of the upper chap of the
  Snail, GGG, and not to be any thing neer so much creas'd as the lower and
  blacker part of it HIIHKKH which was exactly shap'd like teeth, the bone
  growing thinner, or tapering to an edge towards KKK. It seem'd to have
  nine teeth, or prominent parts IK, IK, IF, <i>&amp;c.</i> which were
  join'd together by the thinner interpos'd parts of the bone. The Animal
  to which these teeth belong, is a very <i>anomalous</i> creature, and
  seems of a kind quite distinct from any other terrestrial Animal or
  Insect, the Anatomy whereof exceedingly differing from what has been
  hitherto given of it I should have inserted, but that it will be more
  proper in another place. I have never met with any kind of Animal whose
  teeth are all join'd in one, save onely that I lately observ'd, that all
  the teeth of a Rhinocerot, which grow on either side of its mouth, are
  join'd into one large bone, the weight of one of which I found to be neer
  eleven pound <i>Haverdupois</i>. So that it seems one of the biggest sort
  of terrestrial Animals, as well as one of the smallest, has his teeth
  thus shap'd.</p>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-25.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 25.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 2.
</span>
  <p>The Eggs of Silk-worms (one of which I have describ'd in the second
  <i>Figure</i> of 25. <i>Scheme</i>) afford a pretty Object for a
  <i>Microscope</i> that magnifies very much, especially if it be bright
  weather, and the light of a window be cast or collected on it by a deep
  <i>Convex-glass</i>, or Water-ball. For then the whole surface of the
  Shell may be perceiv'd all cover'd over with exceeding small pits or
  cavities with interposed edges, almost in the manner of the surface of a
  Poppy-seed, but that these holes are not an hundredth part scarce of
  their bigness; the Shell, when the young ones were hatch'd (which I found
  an easie thing to do, if the Eggs were kept in a warm place) appear'd no
  thicker in proportion to its bulk, then that of an Hen's or Goos's Egg is
  to its bulk, and all the Shell appear'd very white (which seem'd to
  proceed from its transparency) whence all those pittings did almost
  vanish, so that they could not, without much difficulty, be discern'd,
  the inside of the Shell seem'd to be lin'd also with a kind of thin film,
  not unlike (keeping the proportion to its Shell) that with which the
  shell of an Hen-egg is lin'd; and the shell it self seem'd like common
  Egg-shells; very brittle, and crack'd. In divers other of these Eggs I
  could plainly enough, through the shell, perceive the small Insect lie
  coyled round the edges of the shell. The shape of the Egg it self, the
  Figure pretty well represents (though by default of the Graver it does
  not appear so rounded, and lying above the
  Paper, as it were, as it ought to do) that is, it was for the most part
  pretty oval end-ways, somewhat like an Egg, but the other way it was a
  little flatted on two opposite sides. Divers of these Eggs, as is common
  to most others, I found to be barren, or addle, for they never afforded
  any young ones. And those I usually found much whiter then the other that
  were prolifick. The Eggs of other kinds of Oviparous Insects I have found
  to be perfectly round every way, like so many Globules, of this sort I
  have observ'd some sorts of Spiders Eggs; and chancing the last Summer to
  inclose a very large and curiously painted Butterfly in a Box, intending
  to examine its gaudery with my <i>Microscope</i>, I found within a day or
  two after I inclos'd her, almost all the inner surface of the Box cover'd
  over with an infinite of exactly round Eggs, which were stuck very fast
  to the sides of it, and in so exactly regular and close an order, that
  made me call to mind my <i>Hypothesis</i>, which I had formerly thought
  on for the making out of all the regular Figures of Salt, which I have
  elsewhere hinted; for here I found all of them rang'd into a most exact
  <i>triagonal</i> order, much after the manner as the <i>Hemispheres</i>
  are place on the eye of a Fly; all which Eggs I found after a little time
  to be hatch'd, and out of them to come a multitude of small Worms, very
  much resembling young Silk-worms, leaving all their thin hollow shells
  behind them, sticking on the Box in their <i>triagonal</i> posture; these
  I found with the <i>Microscope</i> to have much such a substance as the
  Silk-worms Eggs, but could not perceive them pitted. And indeed, there is
  as great a variety in the shape of the Eggs of Oviparous Insects as among
  those of Birds.</p>

  <p>Of these Eggs, a large and lusty Fly will at one time lay neer four or
  five hundred, so that the increase of these kind of Insects must needs be
  very prodigious, were they not prey'd on by multitudes of Birds, and
  destroy'd by Frosts and Rains; and hence 'tis those hotter Climates
  between the <i>Tropicks</i> are infested with such multitudes of Locusts,
  and such other Vermine.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXLII" id="obsXLII">XLII</a>. <i>Of a blue </i>Fly<i>.</i></h3>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-26.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 26.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 1.
</span>
  <p>This kind of Fly, whereof a <i>Microscopical</i> Picture is delineated
  in the first <i>Figure</i> of the 26. <i>Scheme</i>, is a very beautifull
  creature, and has many things about it very notable; divers of which I
  have already partly describ'd, namely, the feet, wings, eyes, and head,
  in the preceding Observations.</p>

  <p>And though the head before describ'd be that of a grey
  <i>Drone-Fly</i>, yet for the main it is very agreeable to this. The
  things wherein they differ most, will be easily enough found by the
  following particulars:</p>

  <p>First, the clusters of eyes of this Fly, are very much smaller then
  those of the <i>Dron-Fly</i>, in proportion to the head.</p>

  <p>And next, all the eyes of each cluster seem'd much of the same bigness
  one with another, not differing as the other, but rang'd in the same
  <i>triagonal</i> order.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, between these two clusters, there was a scaly prominent
  <i>front</i> B, which was arm'd and adorn'd with large tapering sharp
  black brisles, which growing out in rows on either side, were so bent
  toward each other neer the top, as to make a kind of arched arbour of
  Brisles, which almost cover'd the former <i>front</i>.</p>

  <p>Fourthly, at the end of this Arch, about the middle of the face, on a
  prominent part C, grew two small oblong bodies, DD, which through a
  <i>Microscope</i> look'd not unlike the Pendants in Lillies, these seem'd
  to be jointed on to two small parts at C, each of which seem'd again
  jointed into the front.</p>

  <p>Fifthly, out of the upper part and outsides of these horns (as I may
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-24.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 24.</a>
</span>
  call them, from the Figure they are of, in the 24. <i>Scheme</i>, where
  they are marked with FF) there grows a single feather, or brushy Brisle,
  EE, somewhat of the same kind with the tufts of a Gnat, which I have
  before described.</p>

  <p>What the use of these kind of horned and tufted bodies should be, I
  cannot well imagine, unless they serve for smelling or hearing, though
  how they are adapted for either, it seems very difficult to describe:
  they are in almost every several kind of Flies of so various a shape;
  though certainly they are some very essential part of the head, and have
  some very notable office assign'd them by Nature, since in all Insects
  they are to be found in one or other form.</p>

  <p>Sixthly, at the under part of the face FF, were several of the former
  sort of bended Brisles, and below all, the mouth, out of the middle of
  which, grew the <i>proboscis</i> GHI, which, by means of several joints,
  whereof it seem'd to consist, the Fly was able to move to and fro, and
  thrust it in and out as it pleas'd; the end of this hollow body (which
  was all over cover'd with small short hairs or brisles) was, as 'twere,
  bent at H, and the outer or formost side of the bended part HI, slit, as
  it were, into two chaps, HI, HI, all the outside of which where cover'd
  with hairs, and pretty large brisles; these he could, like two chaps,
  very readily open and shut, and when he seem'd to suck any thing from the
  surface of a body, he would spread abroad those chaps, and apply the
  hollow part of them very close to it.</p>

  <p>From either side of the <i>Proboscis</i>, within the mouth, grew two
  other small horns, or fingers, KK, which were hairy, but small in this
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-24.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 24.</a>
</span>
  Figure; but of another shape, and bigger in proportion, in the 24.
  <i>Scheme</i>, where they are marked with GG, which two indeed seem'd a
  kind of smellers, but whether so or not, I cannot positively
  determine.</p>

  <p>The <i>Thorax</i> or middle part of this Fly, was cas'd, both above
  and beneath, with a very firm crust of armour, the upper part more round,
  and covered over with long <i>conical</i> brisles, all whose ends pointed
  backwards; out of the hinder and under part of this grew out in a cluster
  six leggs, three of which are apparent in the Figure, the other three
  were hid by the body plac'd in that posture. The leggs were
  all much of the same make, being all of them cover'd with a strong hairy
  scale or shel, just like the legs of a Crabb or Lobster, and the
  contrivance of the joints seem'd much the same, each legg seem'd made up
  of eight parts, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, to the eighth or last of which,
  grew the soles and claws, described before in the 38.
  <i>Observation</i>.</p>

  <p>Out of the upper part of this trunck grew the two wings, which I
  mention'd in the 38. <i>Observation</i>, consisting of a film, extended
  on certain small stiff wires or bones: these in a blue Fly, were much
  longer then the body, but in other kind of Flies they are of very
  differing proportions to the body. These films, in many Flies, were so
  thin, that, like several other plated bodies (mention'd in the ninth
  <i>Observation</i>) they afforded all varieties of fantastical or
  transient colours (the reason of which I have here endeavoured to
  explain) they seem'd to receive their nourishment from the stalks or
  wires, which seem'd to be hollow, and neer the upper part of the wing LL
  several of them seem'd jointed, the shape of which will sufficiently
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-26.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 26.</a>
</span>
  appear by the black lines in the second Figure of the 26. <i>Scheme</i>,
  which is a delineation of one of those wings expanded directly to the
  eyes.</p>

  <p>All the hinder part of its body is cover'd with a most curious blue
  shining armour, looking exactly like a polish'd piece of steel brought to
  that blue colour by annealing, all which armour is very thick bestuck
  with abundance of tapering brisles, such as grow on its back, as is
  visible enough by the Figure.</p>

  <p>Nor was the inside of this creature less beautifull then its outside,
  for cutting off a part of the belly, and then viewing it, to see if I
  could discover any Vessels, such as are to be found in a greater Animals,
  and even in Snails exceeding manifestly, I found, much beyond my
  expectation, that there were abundance of branchings of Milk-white
  vessels, no less curious then the branchings of veins and arteries in
  bigger terrestrial Animals, in one of which, I found two notable
  branches, joining their two main stocks, as it were, into one common
  <i>ductus</i>; now, to what veins or arteries these Vessells were
  <i>analogus</i>, whether to the <i>vena porta</i>, or the <i>meseraick
  vessells</i>, or the like, or indeed, whether they were veins and
  arteries, or <i>vasa lactea</i>, properly so called, I am not hitherto
  able to determine, having not yet made sufficient enquiry; but in all
  particulars, there seems not to be any thing less of curious contrivance
  in these Insects, then in those larger terrestrial Animals, for I had
  never seen any more curious branchings of Vessels, then those I observ'd
  in two or three of these Flies thus opened.</p>

  <p>It is a creature active and nimble, so as there are very few creatures
  like it, whether bigger or smaller, in so much, that it will scape and
  avoid a small body, though coming on it exceeding swiftly, and if it sees
  any thing approaching it, which it fears, it presently squats down, as it
  were, that it may be the more ready for its rise.</p>

  <p>Nor is it less hardy in the Winter, then active in the Summer,
  induring all the Frosts, and surviving till the next Summer,
  notwithstanding the bitter cold of our Climate;
  nay, this creature will indure to be frozen, and yet not be destroy'd,
  for I have taken one of them out of the Snow whereon it has been frozen
  almost white, with the Ice about it, and yet by thawing it gently by the
  warmth of a fire, it has quickly reviv'd and flown about.</p>

  <p>This kind of Fly seems by the steams or taste of fermenting and
  putrifying meat (which it often kisses, as 'twere, with its
  <i>proboscis</i> as it trips over it) to be stimulated or excited to
  eject its Eggs or Seed on it, perhaps, from the same reason as Dogs,
  Cats, and many other brute creatures are excited to their particular
  lusts, by the smell of their females, when by Nature prepared for
  generation; the males seeming by those kind of smells, or other
  incitations, to be as much necessitated thereto, as <i>Aqua Regis</i>
  strongly impregnated with a solution of Gold, is forced to precipitate it
  by the affusion of spirit of <i>Urine</i>, or a solution of <i>Salt</i>
  of <i>Tartar</i>.</p>

  <p>One of these put in spirit of <i>Wine</i>, was very quickly seemingly
  kill'd, and both its eys and mouth began to look very red, but upon the
  taking of it out, and suffering it to lie three or four hours, and
  heating it with the Sun beams cast through a Burning-glass, it again
  reviv'd, seeming, as it were, to have been all the intermediate time, but
  dead drunk, and after certain hours to grow fresh again and sober.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXLIII" id="obsXLIII">XLIII</a>. <i>Of the </i>Water-Insect<i> or </i>Gnat<i>.</i></h3>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-27.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 27.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 1.
</span>
  <p>This little creature, described in the first <i>Figure</i> of the 27.
  <i>Scheme</i>, was a small scaled or crusted Animal, which I have often
  observ'd to be generated in Rain-water; I have also observ'd it both in
  Pond and River-water. It is suppos'd by some, to deduce its first
  original from the putrifaction of Rain-water, in which, if it have stood
  any time open to the air, you shall seldom miss, all the Summer long, of
  store of them frisking too and fro.</p>

  <p>'Tis a creature, wholly differing in shape from any I ever observ'd;
  nor is its motion less strange: It has a very large head, in proportion
  to its body, all covered with a shell, like other <i>testaceous</i>
  Animals, but it differs in this, that it has, up and down several parts
  of it, several tufts of hairs, or brisles, plac'd in the order express'd
  in the Figure; It has two horns, which seem'd almost like the horns of an
  Oxe, inverted, and, as neer as I could guess, were hollow, with tufts of
  brisles, likewise at the top; these horns they could move easily this or
  that way, and might, perchance, be their nostrils. It has a pretty large
  mouth, which seem'd contriv'd much like those of Crabs and Lobsters, by
  which, I have often observ'd them to feed on water, or some imperceptible
  nutritive substance in it.</p>

  <p>I could perceive, through the transparent shell, while the Animal
  surviv'd, several motions in the head, thorax, and belly, very
  distinctly, of differing kinds which I may, perhaps,
  elsewhere endeavour more accurately to examine, and to shew of how great
  benefit the use of a <i>Microscope</i> may be for the discovery of
  Nature's course in the operations perform'd in Animal bodies, by which we
  have the opportunity of observing her through these delicate and pellucid
  teguments of the bodies of Insects acting according to her usual course
  and way, undisturbed, whereas, when we endeavour to pry into her secrets
  by breaking open the doors upon her, and dissecting and mangling
  creatures whil'st there is life yet within them, we find her indeed at
  work, but put into such disorder by the violence offer'd, as it may
  easily be imagin'd, how differing a thing we should find, if we could, as
  we can with a <i>Microscope</i> in these smaller creatures, quietly peep
  in at the windows, without frighting her out of her usual byas.</p>

  <p>The form of the whole creature, as it appear'd in the
  <i>Microscope</i>, may, without troubling you with more descriptions, be
  plainly enough perceiv'd by the <i>Scheme</i>, the hinder part or belly
  consisting of eight several jointed parts, namely, ABCDEFGH, of the first
  <i>Figure</i>, from the midst of each of which, on either side issued out
  three or four small brisles or hairs, I, I, I, I, I, the tail was divided
  into two parts of very differing make; one of them, namely, K, having
  many tufts of hair or brisles, which seem'd to serve both for the finns
  and tail, for the Oars and Ruder of this little creature, wherewith it
  was able, by frisking and bending its body nimbly to and fro, to move
  himself any whither, and to skull and steer himself as he pleas'd, the
  other part, L, seem'd to be, as 'twere, the ninth division of his belly,
  and had many single brisles on either side. From the end V, of which,
  through the whole belly, there was a kind of Gut of a darker colour, MMM,
  wherein, by certain <i>Peristaltick</i> motions there was a kind of black
  substance mov'd upwards and downwards through it from the orbicular part
  of it, N, (which seem'd the <i>Ventricle</i>, or stomach) to the tail V,
  and so back again, which <i>peristaltick</i> motion I have observ'd also
  in a Louse, a Gnat, and several other kinds of transparent body'd Flies.
  The <i>Thorax</i> or chest of this creature OOOO, was thick and short,
  and pretty transparent, for through it I could see the white heart (which
  is the colour also of the bloud in these, and most other Insects) to
  beat, and several other kind of motions. It was bestuck and adorn'd up
  and down with several tufts of brisles, such as are pointed out by P, P,
  P, P, the head Q was likewise bestuck with several of those tufts, SSS;
  it was broad and short, had two black eyes, TT, which I could not
  perceive at all pearl'd, as they afterwards appear'd, and two small
  horns, RR, such as I formerly describ'd.</p>

  <p>Both its motion and rest is very strange, and pleasant, and differing
  from those of most other creatures I have observ'd; for, where it ceases
  from moving its body, the tail of it seeming much lighter then the rest
  of its body, and a little lighter then the water it swims in, presently
  boys it up to the top of the water, where it hangs suspended with the
  head always downward; and like our <i>Antipodes</i>, if they do by a
  frisk get below that superficies, they presently ascend again unto it, if
  they cease moving, until they tread, as it were, under
  that superficies with their tails; the hanging of these in this posture,
  put me in mind of a certain creature I have seen in <i>London</i>, that
  was brought out of <i>America</i>, which would very firmly suspend it
  self by the tail, with the head downwards, and was said to keep in that
  posture, with her young ones in her false belly, which is a Purse,
  provided by Nature for the production, nutrition, and preservation of her
  young ones, which is described by <i>Piso</i> in the 24. Chapter of the
  fifth Book of his Natural History of <i>Brasil</i>.</p>

  <p>The motion of it was with the tail forwards, drawing its self
  backwards, by the striking to and fro of that tuft which grew out of one
  of the stumps of its tail. It had another motion, which was more sutable
  to that of other creatures, and that is, with the head forward; for by
  the moving of his chaps (if I may so call the parts of his mouth) it was
  able to move it self downwards very gently towards the bottom, and did,
  as 'twere, eat up its way through the water.</p>

  <p>But that which was most observable in this creature, was, its
  Metamorphosis or change; for having kept several of these Animals in a
  Glass of Rain-water, in which they were produc'd, I found, after about a
  fortnight or three weeks keeping, that several of them flew away in
  Gnats, leaving their husks behind them in the water floating under the
  surface, the place where these Animals were wont to reside, whil'st they
  were inhabitants of the water: this made me more diligently to watch
  them, to see if I could find them at the time of their transformation;
  and not long after, I observ'd several of them to be changed into an
  unusual shape, wholly differing from that they were of before, their head
  and body being grown much bigger and deeper, but not broader, and their
  belly, or hinder part smaller, and coyl'd, about this great body much of
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-27.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 27.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 2.
</span>
  the fashion represented by the prick'd line in the second <i>Figure</i>
  of the 27. <i>Scheme</i>, the head and horns now swam uppermost, and the
  whole bulk of the body seem'd to be grown much lighter; for when by my
  frighting of it, it would by frisking out of its tail (in the manner
  express'd in the Figure by BC) sink it self below the surface towards the
  bottom; the body would more swiftly re-ascend, then when it was in its
  former shape.</p>

  <p>I still marked its progress from time to time, and found its body
  still to grow bigger and bigger, Nature, as it were, fitting and
  accoutring it for the lighter Element, of which it was now going to be an
  inhabitant; for, by observing one of these with my <i>Microscope</i>, I
  found the eyes of it to be altogether differing from what they seem'd
  before, appearing now all over pearl'd or knobb'd, like the eyes of
  Gnats, as is visible in the second <i>Figure</i> by A. At length, I saw
  part of this creature to swim above, and part beneath the surface of the
  water, below which though it would quickly plunge it self if I by any
  means frighted it, and presently re-ascend into its former posture; after
  a little longer expectation, I found that the head and body of a Gnat,
  began to appear and stand cleer above the surface, and by degrees it drew
  out its leggs, first the two formost, then the other, at length its whole
  body perfect and entire appear'd out of the husk (which it left in the
  water) standing on its leggs upon the top
  of the water, and by degrees it began to move, and after flew about the
  Glass a perfect Gnat.</p>

  <p>I have been the more particular, and large in the relation of the
  transformation of divers of these little Animals which I observ'd,
  because I have not found that any Authour has observ'd the like, and
  because the thing it self is so strange and heterogeneous from the usual
  progress of other Animals, that I judge it may not onely be pleasant, but
  very usefull and necessary towards the compleating of Natural
  History.</p>

  <p>There is indeed in <i>Piso</i>, a very odd History, which this
  relation may make the more probable; and that is in the 2. Chapter of the
  4. Book of his Natural History of <i>Brasil</i>, where he says, <i>Porro
  præter tot documenta fertilitatis circa vegetabilia &amp; sensitiva
  marina telluris æmula, accidit &amp; illud, quod paucis à Paranambucensi
  milliaribus, piscatoris uncum citra intentionem contingat infigi vadis
  petrosis, &amp; loco piscis spongia, coralla, aliasque arbusculas marinas
  capi. Inter hæc inusitatæ formæ prodit spongiosa arbuscula sesquipedis

  infixa, erigiturque in corpus spongiosum molle oblongum rotundum

  tenaci glutine instar Apum propolis undique vestitum, ostio satis patulo
  &amp; profundo in summitate relicto, sicut ex altera iconum probe depicta

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-27.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 27.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 3. &amp; 4.
</span>
  the third and fourth <i>Figures</i> of the 27.
  <i>Scheme</i>.)<i> Ita ut Apiarium marinum vere dixeris; primo enim
  intuitu è Mare ad Terram delatum, vermiculis scatebat cæruleis parvis,
  qui mox à calore solis in Muscas, vel Apes potius, easq; exiguas &amp;

  qualiscunque substantia proculdubio urinatoribus patebit, ubi curiosius
  inquisiverint hæc apiaria, eaque in natali solo &amp; salo diversis
  temporibus penitius lustrarint</i>.</p>

  <p>Which History contains things sufficiently strange to be consider'd,
  as whether the husk were a Plant, growing at the bottom of the Sea
  before, of it self, out of whose putrifaction might be generated these
  strange kind of Magots; or whether the seed of certain Bees, sinking to
  the bottom, might there naturally form it self that vegetable hive, and
  take root; or, whether it might not be placed there by some diving Fly;
  or, whether it might not be some peculiar propriety of that Plant,
  whereby it might ripen or form its vegetable juice into an Animal
  substance; or, whether it may not be of the nature of a Sponge, or rather
  a Sponge of the nature of this, according to some of those relations and
  conjectures I formerly made of that body, is a matter very difficult to
  be determined. But indeed, in this description, the Excellent <i>Piso</i>
  has not been sufficiently particular in the setting down the whole
  process, as it were to be wish'd: There are indeed very odd progresses in
  the production of several kinds of Insects, which are not less
  instructive then pleasant, several of which, the diligent
  <i>Goedartius</i> has carefully observ'd and recorded, but among all his
  Observations, he has none like this, though that of the <i>Hemerobius</i>
  be somewhat of this kind, which is added as an Appendix by <i>Johannes
  Mey</i>.</p>

  <p>I have, for my own particular, besides several of those mention'd by
  him, observ'd divers other circumstances, perhaps, not much taken notice
  of, though very common, which do indeed afford us a very <i>coercive</i>
  argument to admire the goodness and providence of the infinitely wise
  Creator in his most excellent contrivances and dispensations. I have
  observ'd, at several times of the Summer, that many of the leaves of
  divers Plants have been spotted, or, as it were scabbed, and looking on
  the undersides of those of them that have been but a litte irregular, I
  have perceiv'd them to be sprinkled with divers sorts of little Eggs,
  which letting alone, I have found by degrees to grow bigger, and become
  little Worms with leggs, but still to keep their former places, and those
  places of the leaves, of their own accords, to be grown very protuberant
  upwards, and very hollow, and arched underneath, whereby those young
  creatures are, as it were, shelter'd and housed from external injury;
  divers leaves I have observ'd to grow and swell so farr, as at length
  perfectly to inclose the Animal, which, by other observations I have
  made, I ghess to contain it, and become, as it were a womb to it, so
  long, till it be fit and prepar'd to be translated into another state, at
  what time, like (what they say of) Vipers, they gnaw their way through
  the womb that bred them; divers of these kinds I have met with upon
  Goosberry leaves, Rose-tree leaves, Willow leaves, and many other
  kinds.</p>

  <p>There are often to be found upon Rose-trees and Brier bushes, little
  red tufts, which are certain knobs or excrescencies, growing out from the
  Rind, or barks of those kinds of Plants, they are cover'd with strange
  kinds of threads or red hairs, which feel very soft, and look not
  unpleasantly. In most of these, if it has no hole in it, you shall find
  certain little Worms, which I suppose to be the causes of their
  production; for when that Worm has eat its way through, they, having
  performed what they were design'd by Nature to do, by degrees die and
  wither away.</p>

  <p>Now, the manner of their production, I suppose to be thus, that the
  Alwise Creator has as well implanted in every creature a faculty of
  knowing what place is convenient for the hatching, nutrition, and
  preservation of their Eggs and of-springs whereby they are stimulated and
  directed to convenient places, which becom, as 'twere the wombs that
  perform those offices: As he has also suited and adapted a property to
  those places wherby they grow and inclose those seeds, and having
  inclosed them, provide a convenient nourishment for them, but as soon as
  they have done the office of a womb, they die and wither.</p>

  <p>The progress of inclosure I have often observ'd in leaves, which in
  those places where those seeds have been cast, have by degrees swell'd
  and inclos'd them, so perfectly round, as not to leave any perceptible
  passage out.</p>

  <p>From this same cause, I suppose that Galls, Oak-apples, and several
  other productions of that kind, upon the branches and leaves of Trees,
  have their original, for if you open any of them, when almost ripe, you
  shall find a little Worm in them. Thus, if you open never so many dry
  Galls, you shall find either a hole whereby the Worm has eat its passage
  out, or if you find no passage, you may, by
  breaking or cutting the Gall, find in the middle of it a small cavity,
  and in it a small body, which does plainly enough yet retain a shape, to
  manifest it once to have been a Worm, though it dy'd by a too early
  reparation from the Oak on which it grew, its navel-string, as 'twere,
  being broken off from the leaf or branch by which the Globular body that
  invelop'd it, received its nourishment from the Oak.</p>

  <p>And indeed, if we consider the great care of the Creator in the
  dispensations of his providences for the propagation and increase of the
  race, not onely of all kind of Animals, but even of Vegetables, we cannot
  chuse but admire and adore him for his Excellencies, but we shall leave
  off to admire the creature, or to wonder at the strange kind of acting in
  several Animals, which seem to favour so much of reason; it seeming to me
  most manifest, that those are but actings according to their structures,
  and such operations as such bodies, so compos'd, must necessarily, when
  there are such and such circumstances concurring, perform: thus, when we
  find Flies swarming, about any piece of flesh that does begin a little to
  ferment; Butterflies about Colworts, and several other leaves, which will
  serve to hatch and nourish their young; Gnats, and several other Flies
  about the Waters, and marishy places, or any other creatures, seeking and
  placing their Seeds in convenient repositories, we may, if we attentively
  consider and examine it, find that there are circumstances sufficient,
  upon the supposals of the excellent contrivance of their machine, to
  excite and force them to act after such or such a manner; those steams
  that rise from these several places may, perhaps, set several parts of
  these little Animals at work, even as in the contrivance of killing a Fox
  or Wolf with a Gun, the moving of a string, is the death of the Animal;
  for the Beast, by moving the flesh that is laid to entrap him, pulls the
  string which moves the trigger, and that lets go the Cock which on the
  steel strikes certain sparks of fire which kindle the powder in the pann,
  and that presently flies into the barrel, where the powder catching fire
  rarifies and drives out the bullet which kills the Animal; in all which
  actions, there is nothing of intention or ratiocination to be ascrib'd
  either to the Animal or Engine, but all to the ingeniousness of the
  contriver.</p>

  <p>But to return to the more immediate consideration of our Gnat: We have
  in it an Instance, not usual or common, of a very strange
  <i>amphibious</i> creature, that being a creature that inhabits the Air,
  does yet produce a creature, that for some time lives in the water as a
  Fish, though afterward (which is as strange) it becomes an inhabitant of
  the Air, like its Sire, in the form of a Fly. And this, methinks, does
  prompt me to propose certain conjectures, as Queries, having not yet had
  sufficient opportunity and leisure to answer them my self from my own
  Experiments or Observations.</p>

  <p>And the first is, Whether all those things that we suppose to be bred
  from corruption and putrifaction, may not be rationally suppos'd to have
  their origination as natural as these Gnats, who, 'tis very probable,
  were first dropt into this Water, in the form of Eggs. Those Seeds or
  Eggs must certainly be very small, which so
  small a creature as a Gnat yields, and therefore, we need not wonder that
  we find not the Eggs themselves, some of the younger of them, which I
  have observ'd, having not exceeded a tenth part of the bulk they have
  afterwards come to; and next, I have observed some of those little ones
  which must have been generated after the Water was inclosed in the
  Bottle, and therefore most probably from Eggs, whereas those creatures
  have been suppos'd to be bred of the corruption of the Water, there being
  not formerly known any probable way how they should be generated.</p>

  <p>A second is, whether these Eggs are immediately dropt into the Water
  by the Gnats themselves, or, mediately, are brought down by the falling
  rain; for it seems not very improbable, but that those small seeds of
  Gnats may (being, perhaps, of so light a nature, and having so great a
  proportion of surface to so small a bulk of body) be ejected into the
  Air, and so, perhaps, carried for a good while too and fro in it, till by
  the drops of Rain it be wash'd out of it.</p>

  <p>A third is, whether multitudes of those other little creatures that
  are found to inhabit the Water for some time, do not, at certain times,
  take wing and fly into the Air, others dive and hide themselves in the
  Earth, and so contribute to the increase both of the one and the other
  Element.</p>

<h3><i>Postscript.</i></h3>

  <p>A good while since the writing of this Description, I was presented by
  Doctor <i>Peter Ball</i>, an ingenious Member of the <i>Royal
  Society</i>, with a little Paper of Nuts, which he told me was sent him
  from a Brother of his out of the Countrey, from <i>Mamhead</i> in
  <i>Devonshire</i>, some of them were loose, having been, as I suppose,
  broken off, others were still growing fast on upon the sides of a stick,
  which seem'd by the bark, pliableness of it, and by certain strings that
  grew out of it, to be some piece of the root of a Tree; they were all of
  them dry'd, and a little shrivell'd, others more round, of a brown
  colour; their shape was much like a Figg, but very much smaller, some
  being about the bigness of a Bay-berry, others, and the biggest, of a
  Hazel-Nut. Some of these that had no hole in them, I carefully opened
  with my Knife, and found in them a good large round white Maggot, almost
  as bigg as a small Pea, which seem'd shap'd like other Maggots, but
  shorter. I could not find them to move, though I ghess'd them to be
  alive, because upon pricking them with a Pinn, there would issue out a
  great deal of white <i>mucous</i> matter, which seem'd to be from a
  voluntary contraction of their skin; their husk or matrix consisted of
  three Coats, like the barks of Trees, the outermost being more rough and
  spongie, and the thickest, the middlemost more close, hard, white, and
  thin, the innermost very thin, seeming almost like the skin within an
  Egg's shell. The two outermost had root in the branch or stick, but the
  innermost had no stem or process, but was onely a skin that cover'd the
  cavity of the Nut. All the Nuts that had no holes eaten in them, I found
  to contain these Maggots, but all that had holes, I found empty, the
  Maggots, it seems, having eaten their way through,
  taken wings and flown away, as this following account (which I receiv'd
  in writing from the same person, as it was sent him by his Brother)
  manifests. <i>In a moorish black Peaty mould, with some small veins of
  whitish yellow Sands, upon occasion of digging a hole two or three foot
  deep, at the head of a Pond or Pool, to set a Tree in, at that depth,
  were found, about the end of </i>October 1663.<i> in those very veins of
  Sand, those Buttons or Nuts, sticking to a little loose stick, that is,
  not belonging to any live Tree, and some of them also free by
  themselves.</i></p>

  <p><i>Four or five of which being then open'd, some were found to contain
  live Insects come to perfection, most like to flying </i>Ants<i>, if not
  the same; in others, Insects, yet imperfect, having but the head and
  wings form'd, the rest remaining a soft white pulpy substance.</i></p>

  <p>Now, as this furnishes us with one odd History more, very agreeable to
  what I before hinted, so I doubt not, but were men diligent observers,
  they might meet with multitudes of the same kind, both in the Earth and
  in the Water, and in the Air, on Trees, Plants, and other Vegetables, all
  places and things being, as it were, <i>animarum plena</i>. And I have
  often, with wonder and pleasure, in the Spring and Summer-time, look'd
  close to, and diligently on, common Garden mould, and in a very small
  parcel of it, found such multitudes and diversities of little
  <i>reptiles</i>, some in husks, others onely creepers, many wing'd, and
  ready for the Air; divers husks or habitations left behind empty. Now, if
  the Earth of our cold Climate be so fertile of animate bodies, what may
  we think of the fat Earth of hotter Climates? Certainly, the Sun may
  there, by its activity, cause as great a parcel of Earth to fly on wings
  in the Air, as it does of Water in steams and vapours. And what swarms
  must we suppose to be sent out of those plentifull inundations of water
  which are poured down by the sluces of Rain in such vast quantities? So
  that we need not much wonder at those innumerable clouds of Locusts with
  which <i>Africa</i>, and other hot countries are so pestred, since in
  those places are found all the convenient causes of their production,
  namely, genitors, or Parents, concurrent receptacles or matrixes, and a
  sufficient degree of natural heat and moisture.</p>

  <p>I was going to annex a little draught of the Figure of those Nuts sent
  out of <i>Devonshire</i>, but chancing to examine Mr. <i>Parkinson</i>'s
  Herbal for something else, and particularly about Galls and Oak-apples, I
  found among no less then 24. several kinds of excrescencies of the Oak,
  which I doubt not, but upon examination, will be all found to be the
  <i>matrixes</i> of so many several kinds of Insects; I having observ'd
  many of them my self to be so, among 24. several kinds, I say, I found
  one described and Figur'd directly like that which I had by me, the
  <i>Scheme</i> is there to be seen, the description, because but short, I
  have here adjoin'd <i>Theatri Botanici trib. 16. Chap. 2. There groweth
  at the roots of old Oaks in the Spring-time, and semetimes also in the
  very heat of Summer, a peculiar kind of Mushrom or Excrescence, call'd
  </i>Uva Quercina<i>, swelling out of the Earth, many growing one close
  unto another, of the fashion of a Grape, and therefore took the name, the
  </i>Oak-Grape<i>, and is of a Purplish colour on the outside,
  and white within like Milk, and in the end
  of Summer becometh hard and woody.</i> Whether this be the very same
  kind, I cannot affirm, but both the Picture and Description come very
  neer to that I have, but that he seems not to take notice of the
  hollowness or Worm, for which 'tis most observable. And therefore 'tis
  very likely, if men did but take notice, they might find very many
  differing Species of these Nuts, <i>Ovaries</i>, or <i>Matrixes</i>, and
  all of them to have much the same designation and office. And I have very
  lately found several kinds of Excrescencies on Trees and Shrubs, which
  having endured the Winter, upon opening them, I found most of them to
  contain little Worms, but dead, those things that contain'd them being
  wither'd and dry.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXLIV" id="obsXLIV">XLIV</a>. <i>Of the tufted or Brush-horn'd </i>Gnat<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>This little creature was one of those multitudes that fill our
  <i>English</i> air all the time that warm weather lasts, and is exactly
  of the shape of that I observ'd to be generated and hatch'd out of those
  little Insects that wriggle up and down in Rain-water. But, though many
  were of this form, yet I observ'd others to be of quite other kinds; nor
  were all of this or the other kind generated out of Water Insects; for
  whereas I observ'd that those that proceeded from those Insects were at
  their full growth, I have also found multitudes of the same shape, but
  much smaller and tenderer seeming to be very young ones, creep up and
  down upon the leaves of Trees, and flying up and down in small clusters,
  in places very remote from water; and this Spring, I observ'd one day,
  when the Wind was very calm, and the afternoon very fair, and pretty
  warm, though it had for a long time been very cold weather, and the wind
  continued still in the East, several small swarms of them playing to and
  fro in little clouds in the Sun, each of which were not a tenth part of
  the bigness of one of these I here have delineated, though very much of
  the same shape, which makes me ghess, that each of these swarms might be
  the of-spring of one onely Gnat, which had been hoorded up in some safe
  repository all this Winter by some provident Parent, and were now, by the
  warmth of the Spring-air, hatch'd into little Flies.</p>

  <p>And indeed, so various, and seemingly irregular are the generations or
  productions of Insects, that he that shall carefully and diligently
  observe the several methods of Nature therein, will have infinitely cause
  further to admire the wisdom and providence of the Creator; for not onely
  the same kind of creature may be produc'd from several kinds of ways, but
  the very same creature may produce several kinds: For, as divers Watches
  may be made out of several materials, which may yet have all the same
  appearance, and move after the same manner, that is, shew the hour
  equally true, the one as the other, and out of the same kind of matter,
  like Watches, may be wrought differing ways; and, as one and the same
  Watch may, by being diversly agitated, or mov'd,
  by this or that agent, or after this or that manner, produce a quite
  contrary effect: So may it be with these most curious Engines of Insect's
  bodies; the All-wise God of Nature, may have so ordered and disposed the
  little <i>Automatons</i>, that when nourished, acted, or enlivened by
  this cause, they produce one kind of effect, or animate shape, when by
  another they act quite another way, and another Animal is produc'd. So
  may he so order several materials, as to make them, by several kinds of
  methods, produce similar <i>Automatons</i>.</p>

  <p>But to come to the Description of this Insect, as it appears through a
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-28.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 28.</a>
</span>
  <i>Microscope</i>, of which a representation is made in the 28.
  <i>Scheme</i>. Its head A, is exceeding small, in proportion to its body,
  consisting of two clusters of pearl'd eyes BB, on each side of its head,
  whose pearls or eye-balls are curiously rang'd like those of other Flies;
  between these, in the forehead of it, there are plac'd upon two small
  black balls, CC, two long jointed horns, tapering towards the top, much
  resembling the long horns of Lobsters, each of whose stems or quills, DD,
  were brisled or brushed with multitudes of small stiff hairs, issuing out
  every way from the several joints, like the strings or sproutings of the
  herb <i>Horse-tail</i>, which is oft observ'd to grow among Corn, and for
  the whole shape, it does very much resemble those <i>brushy
  Vegetables</i>; besides these, there are two other jointed and brisled
  horns, or feelers, EE, in the forepart of the head, and a
  <i>proboscis</i>, F, underneath, which in some Gnats are very long,
  streight hollow pipes, by which these creatures are able to drill and
  penetrate the skin, and thence, through those pipes suck so much bloud as
  to stuff their bellies so full till they be ready to burst.</p>

  <p>This small head, with its appurtenances, is fastned on by a short
  neck, G, to the middle of the <i>thorax</i>, which is large, and seems
  cased with a strong black shel, HIK, out of the under part of which,
  issue six long and slender legs, LLLLLL, shap'd just like the legs of
  Flies, but spun or drawn out longer and slenderer, which could not be
  express'd in the Figure, because of their great length; and from the
  upper part, two oblong, but slender transparent wings, MM, shaped
  somewhat like those of a Fly, underneath each of which, as I have
  observ'd also in divers sorts of Flies, and other kinds of Gnats, was
  placed a small body, N, much resembling a drop of some transparent
  glutinous substance, hardned or cool'd, as it was almost ready to fall,
  for it has a round knob at the end, which by degrees grows slenderer into
  a small stem, and neer the insertion under the wing, this stem again
  grows bigger; these little <i>Pendulums</i>, I may so call them, the
  litle creature vibrates to and fro very quick when it moves its wings,
  and I have sometimes observ'd it to move them also, whil'st the wing lay
  still, but always their motion seem'd to further the motion of the wing
  ready to follow; of what use they are, as to the moving of the wing, or
  otherwise, I have not now time to examine.</p>

  <p>Its belly was large, as it is usually in all Insects, and extended
  into nine lengths or partitions, each of which was cover'd with round
  armed rings or shells; six of which, OPQRST were transparent, and divers
  kinds of <i>Peristaltick</i> motions might be very easily perceiv'd,
  whil'st the Animal was alive, but especially a
  small cleer white part V, seemed to beat like the heart of a larger
  Animal. The last three divisios, WXY, were cover'd with black and opacous
  shells. To conclude, take this creature altogether, and for beauty and
  curious contrivances, it may be compared with the largest Animal upon the
  Earth. Nor doth the Alwise Creator seem to have shewn less care and
  providence in the fabrick of it, then in those which seem most
  considerable.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXLV" id="obsXLV">XLV</a>. <i>Of the great Belly'd </i>Gnat<i> or female </i>Gnat<i>.</i></h3>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-29.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 29.</a>
</span>
  <p>The second Gnat, delineated in the twenty ninth <i>Scheme</i>, is of a
  very differing shape from the former; but yet of this sort also, I found
  several of the Gnats, that were generated out of the Water Insect: the
  wings of this, were much larger then those of the other, and the belly
  much bigger, shorter and of an other shape; and, from several
  particulars, I ghest it to be the Female Gnat, and the former to be the
  Male.</p>

  <p>The <i>thorax</i> of this, was much like that of the other, having a
  very strong and ridged back-piece, which went also on either side of its
  leggs; about the wings there were several joynted pieces of Armor, which
  seem'd curiously and conveniently contriv'd, for the promoting and
  strengthning the motion of the wings: its head was much differing from
  the other, being much bigger and neater shap'd, and the horns that grew
  out between his eyes on two little balls, were of a very differing shape
  from the tufts of the other Gnat, these having but a few knots or joynts,
  and each of those but a few, and those short and strong, brisles. The
  formost horns or feelers, were like those of the former Gnat.</p>

  <p>One of these Gnats I have suffer'd to pierce the skin of my hand, with
  its <i>proboscis</i>, and thence to draw out as much blood as to fill its
  belly as full as it could hold, making it appear very red and
  transparent; and this without any further pain, then whilst it was
  sinking in its <i>proboscis</i>, as it is also in the stinging of Fleas:
  a good argument, that these creatures do not wound the skin, and suck the
  blood out of enmity and revenge, but for meer necessity, and to satisfy
  their hunger. By what means this creature is able to suck, we shall shew
  in another place.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXLVI" id="obsXLVI">XLVI</a>. <i>Of the white featherwing'd </i>Moth<i> or </i>Tinea
Argentea<i>.</i></h3>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-30.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 30.</a>
</span>
  <p>This white long wing'd Moth, which is delineated in the 30.
  <i>Scheme</i>; afforded a lovely object both to the naked Eye, and
  through a <i>Microscope</i>: to the Eye it appear'd a small Milk white
  Fly with four white Wings, the two formost
  somewhat longer then the two hindermost, and the two shorter about half
  an Inch long, each of which four Wings seem'd to consist of two small
  long Feathers, very curiously tufted, or haired on each side, with purely
  white, and exceedingly fine and small Haires, proportion'd to the stalks
  or stems, out of which they grew, much like the tufts of a long
  wing-feather of some Bird, and their stalks or stems were, like those,
  bended backwards and downwards, as may be plainly seen by the draughts of
  them in the Figure.</p>

  <p>Observing one of these in my <i>Microscope</i>, I found, in the first
  place, that all the Body, Legs, Horns and the Stalks of the Wings, were
  covered over with various kinds of curious white Feathers, which did,
  with handling or touching, easily rubb off and fly about, in so much that
  looking on my Fingers, with which I had handled this Moth, and perceiving
  on them little white specks, I found by my <i>Microscope</i>, that they
  were several of the small Feathers of this little creature, that stuck up
  and down in the <i>rugosities</i> of my Skin.</p>

  <p>Next, I found that underneath these Feathers, the pretty Insect was
  covered all over with a crusted Shell, like other of those Animals, but
  with one much thinner and tenderer.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, I found, as in Birds also is notable, it had differing and
  appropriate kinds of Feathers, that covered several parts of its
  body.</p>

  <p>Fourthly, surveying the parts of its body, with a more accurate and
  better Magnifying <i>Microscope</i>, I found that the tufts or haires of
  its Wings were nothing else but a congeries, or thick set cluster of
  small <i>vimina</i> or twiggs, resembling a small twigg of Birch, stript
  or whitned, with which Brushes are usually made, to beat out or brush off
  the dust from Cloth and Hangings. Every one of the twiggs or branches
  that composed the Brush of the Feathers, appeared in this bigger
  Magnifying Glass (of which EF which represents ½4 part of an Inch, is the
  scale, as G is of the lesser, which is only 1/3) like the figure D. The
  Feathers also that covered a part of his Body, and were interspersed
  among the brush of his Wings, I found, in the bigger Magnifying Glass, of
  the shape A, consisting of a stalk or stem in the middle, and a seeming
  tuftedness or brushy part on each side. The Feathers that cover'd most
  part of his Body and the stalk of his wings, were, in the same
  <i>Microscope</i>, much of the figure B, appearing of the shape of a
  small Feather, and seemed tufted: those which covered the Horns and small
  parts of the Leggs, through the same <i>Microscope</i>, appear'd of the
  shape C. Whether the tufts of any or all of these small Feathers,
  consisted of such component particles as the Feathers of Birds, I much
  doubt, because I find that Nature does not alwaies keep, or operate after
  the same method, in smaller and bigger creatures. And of this, we have
  particular Instances in the Wings of several creatures. For whereas, in
  Birds of all kinds, it composes each of the Feathers of which its Wing
  consists, of such an exceeding curious and most admirable and stupendious
  texture, as I else where shew, in the Observations on a Feather; we find
  it to alter its method quite, in the fabrick of the Wings of these minute
  creatures, composing some of thin extended membranes
  or skins, such as the Wings of Dragon-flys; in others, those skins are
  all over-grown, or pretty thick bestuck, with short brisles, as in
  Flesh-flies; in others, those filmes are covered, both on the upper and
  under side, with small Feathers, plac'd almost like the tyles on a House,
  and are curiously rang'd and adorn'd with most lively colours, as is
  observable in Butter-flies, and several kinds of Moths; In others,
  instead of their films, Nature has provided nothing, but a matter of half
  a score stalks (if I well remember the number; for I have not lately met
  with any of these flys, and did not, when I first observ'd them, take
  sufficient notice of divers particulars) and each of these stalks, with a
  few single branchings on each side, resembling much the branched
  back-bone of a Herring or the like Fish, or a thin hair'd Peacocks
  feather, the top or the eye being broken off. With a few of these on
  either side (which it was able to shut up or expand at pleasure, much
  like a Fann, or rather like the posture of the feathers in a wing,
  whichly all one under another, when shut, and by the side of each other,
  when expanded) this pretty little grey Moth (for such was the creature I
  observ'd, thus wing'd) could very nimbly, and as it seem'd very easily
  move its <i>corpuscle</i>, through the Air, from place to place. Other
  Insects have their wings cas'd, or cover'd over, with certain hollow
  shells, shap'd almost like those hollow Trayes, in which Butchers carry
  meat, whose hollow sides being turn'd downwards, do not only secure their
  folded wings from injury of the earth, in which most of those creatures
  reside, but whilst they fly, serves as a help to sustain and bear them
  up. And these are observable in <i>Scarabees</i> and a multitude of other
  terrestrial <i>crustaceous</i> Insects; in which we may yet further
  observe a particular providence of Nature.</p>

  <p>Now in all these kinds of wings, we observe this particular, as a
  thing most worthy remark; that where ever a wing consists of discontinued
  parts, the Pores or <i>interstitia</i> between those parts are very
  seldom, either much bigger, or much smaller, then these which we here
  find between the particles of these brushes, so that it should seem to
  intimate, that the parts of the Air are such, that they will not easily
  or readily, if at all, pass through these Pores, so that they seem to be
  strainers fine enough to hinder the particles of the Air (whether
  hinder'd by their bulk, or by their <i>agitation</i>, <i>circulation</i>,
  <i>rotation</i> or <i>undulation</i>, I shall not here determine) from
  getting through them, and, by that means, serve the Animal as well, if
  not better, then if they were little films. I say, if not better, because
  I have observ'd that all those creatures, that have film'd wings, move
  them aboundantly quicker and more strongly, such as all kind of Flies and
  <i>Scarabees</i> and Batts, then such as have their wings covered with
  feathers, as Butter-flies and Birds, or twiggs, as Moths, which have each
  of them a much slower motion of their wings; That little ruggedness
  perhaps of their wings helping them somewhat, by taking better hold of
  the parts of the Air, or not suffering them so easily to pass by, any
  other way then one.</p>

  <p>But what ever be the reason of it, 'tis most evident, that the smooth
  wing'd Insects, have the strongest Muscles or movent parts of their
  wings, and the other much weaker; and this very Insect, we are now
  describing, had a very small <i>thorax</i> or middle
  part of his body, if compar'd to the length and number of his wings;
  which therefore, as he mov'd them very slowly, so must he move them very
  weakly. And this last propriety do we find somewhat observ'd also in
  bigger kind of Flying creatures, Birds; so that we see that the Wisdom
  and Providence of the All-wise Creator, is not less shewn in these small
  despicable creatures, Flies and Moths, which we have branded with a name
  of ignominy, calling them Vermine, then in those greater and more
  remakable animate bodies, Birds.</p>

  <p>I cannot here stand to add any thing about the nature of flying,
  though, perhaps, on another occasion, I may say something on that
  subject, it being such as may deserve a much more accurate examination
  and scrutiny then it has hitherto met with; For to me there seems nothing
  wanting to make a man able to fly, but what may be easily enough supply'd
  from the Mechanicks hitherto known, save onely the want of strength,
  which the Muscles of a man seem utterly uncapable of, by reason of their
  smalness and texture, but how even strength also may be mechanically
  made, and an artificial Muscle so contriv d, that thereby a man shall be
  able to exert what strength he pleases, and to regulate it also to his
  own mind, I may elsewhere endeavour to manifest.</p>

  <p>The Carter, Shepherd Spider, or long-legg'd Spider, has, for two
  particularities, very few similar creatures that I have met with, the
  first, which is discoverable onely by the <i>Microscope</i>, and is in
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-31.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 31.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 1. &amp; 2.
</span>
  the first and second <i>Figures</i> of the 31. <i>Scheme</i>, plainly
  describ'd, is the curious contrivance of his eyes, of which (differing
  from most other Spiders) he has onely two, and those plac'd upon the top
  of a small pillar or hillock, rising out of the middle of the top of its
  back, or rather the crown of its head, for they were fix'd on the very
  top of this pillar (which is about the heighth of one of the transverse
  Diameters of the eye, and look'd on in another posture, appear'd much of
  the shape, BCD.) The two eyes, BB, were placed back to back, with the
  transparent parts, or the pupils, looking towards either side, but
  somewhat more forward then backwards. C was the column or neck on which
  they stood, and D the crown of the head out of which that neck
  sprung.</p>

  <p>These eyes, to appearance, seem'd to be of the very same structure
  with that of larger <i>binocular</i> creatures, seeming to have a very
  smooth and very protuberant <i>Cornea</i>, and in the midst of it to
  have a very black pupil, incompassed about with a kind of grey
  <i>Iris</i>, as appears by the <i>Figure</i>; whether it were able to
  move these eyes to and fro, I have not observ'd, but 'tis not very likely
  he should, the pillar or neck C, seeming to be cover'd and stiffen'd with
  a crusty shell; but Nature, in probability, has supply'd
  that defect, by making the <i>Cornea</i> so very protuberant, and setting
  it so cleer above the shadowing or obstructing of its prospect by the
  body, that 'tis likely each eye may perceive, though not see distinctly,
  almost a <i>Hemisphere</i>, whence having so small and round a body
  plac'd upon such long leggs, it is quickly able so to wind, and turn it,
  as to see any thing distinct. This creature, as do all other Spiders I
  have yet examin'd, does very much differ from most other Insects in the
  Figure of its eyes; for I cannot, with my best <i>Microscope</i>,
  discover its eyes to be any ways knobb'd or pearl'd like those of other
  Insects.</p>

  <p>The second Peculiarity which is obvious to the eye, is also very
  remarkable, and that is the prodigious length of its leggs, in proportion
  to its small round body, each legg of this I drew, being above sixteen
  times the length of its whole body, and there are some which have them
  yet longer, and others that seem of the same kind, that have them a great
  deal shorter; the eight leggs are each of them jointed, just like those
  of a Crab, but every of the parts are spun out prodigiously longer in
  proportion; each of these leggs are terminated in a small case or shell,
  shap'd almost like that of a Musle-shell, as is evident in the third
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-31.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 31.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 3.
</span>
  <i>Figure</i> of the same <i>Scheme</i> (that represents the appearance
  ot the under part or belly of the creature) by the shape of the
  protuberant <i>conical</i> body, IIII, <i>&amp;c.</i> These are as 'twere
  plac'd or fasten'd on to the protuberant body of the Insect, which is to
  be suppos'd very high at M, making a kind of blunt cone whereof M is to
  be suppos'd the <i>Apex</i>, about which greater cone of the body, the
  smaller cones of the leggs are plac'd, each of them almost reaching to
  the top in so admirable a manner, as does not a little manifest the
  wisdom of Nature in the contrivance; for these long Leavers (as I may so
  call them) of the legs, having not the advantage of a long end on the
  other side of the <i>hypomochlion</i> or centers on which the parts of
  the leggs move, must necessarily require a vast strength to move them,
  and keep the body ballanc'd and suspended, in so much, that if we should
  suppose a man's body suspended by such a contrivance, an hundred and
  fifty times the strength of a man would not keep the body from falling on
  the breast. To supply therefore each of these leggs with its proper
  strength, Nature has allow'd to each a large Chest or Cell, in which is
  included a very large and strong Muscle, and thereby this little Animal
  is not onely able to suspend its body upon less then these eight, but to
  move it very swiftly over the tops of grass and leaves.</p>

  <p>Nor are these eight leggs so prodigiously long, but the ninth, and
  tenth, which are the two claws, KK, are as short, and serve in steed of a
  <i>proboscis</i>, for those seem'd very little longer then his mouth;
  each of them had three parts, but very short, the joints KK, which
  represented the third, being longer then both the other. This creature,
  seems (which I have several times with pleasure observ'd) to throw its
  body upon the prey, insteed of its hands, not unlike a hunting Spider,
  which leaps like a Cat at a Mouse. The whole Fabrick was a very pretty
  one, and could I have dissected it, I doubt not but I should have found
  as many singularities within it as without, perhaps, for the most part,
  not unlike the parts of a Crab, which this little
  creature does in many things, very much resemble; the curiosity of whose
  contrivance, I have in another place examin'd. I omit the description of
  the horns, AA, of the mouth, LL, which seem'd like that of a Crab; the
  speckledness of his shell, which proceeded from a kind of feathers or
  hairs, and the hairiness of his leggs, his large <i>thorax</i> and little
  belly, and the like, they being manifested by the Figure; and shall onely
  take notice that the three parts of the body, namely, the head, breast,
  and belly, are in this creature strangely confus'd, so that 'tis
  difficult to determine which is which, as they are also in a Crab; and
  indeed, this seems to be nothing else, but an Air-crab, being made more
  light and nimble, proportionable to the <i>medium</i> wherin it resides;
  and as Air seems to have but one thousandth part of the body of Water, so
  does this Spider seem not to be a thousandth part of the bulk of a
  Crab.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXLVIII" id="obsXLVIII">XLVIII</a>. <i>Of the hunting </i>Spider<i>, and several other sorts
of </i>Spiders<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>The hunting Spider is a small grey Spider, prettily bespeck'd with
  black spots all over its body, which the <i>Microscope</i> discovers to
  be a kind of feathers like those on Butterflies wings, or the body of the
  white Moth I lately describ'd. Its gate is very nimble by fits, sometimes
  running, and sometimes leaping, like a Grashopper almost, then standing
  still, and setting it self on its hinder leggs, it will very nimbly turn
  its body, and look round it self every way: It has six very conspicuous
  eyes, two looking directly forwards, plac'd just before; two other, on
  either side of those, looking forward and side-ways; and two other about
  the middle of the top of its back or head, which look backwards and
  side-wards; these seem'd to be the biggest. The surface of them all was
  very black, sphærical, purely polish'd, reflecting a very cleer and
  distinct Image of all the ambient objects, such as a window, a man's
  hand, a white Paper, or the like. Some other properties of this Spider,
  observ'd by the most accomplish'd Mr. <i>Evelyn</i>, in his travels in
  <i>Italy</i>, are most emphatically set forth in the History hereunto
  annexed, which he was pleas'd upon my desire to send me in writing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of all the sorts of Insects, there is none has afforded me more
  divertisements then the <i>Venatores</i>, which are a sort of
  <i>Lupi</i>, that have their Denns in the rugged walls, and crevices of
  our houses; a small brown and delicately spotted kind of Spiders, whose
  hinder leggs are longer then the rest.</p>

  <p>Such I did frequently observe at <i>Rome</i>, which espying a Fly at
  three or four yards distance, upon the Balcony (where I stood)
  would not make directly to her, but craul
  under the Rail, till being arriv'd to the <i>Antipodes</i>, it would
  steal up, seldom missing its aim; but if it chanced to want any thing of
  being perfectly opposite, would at first peep, immediatly slide down
  again, till taking better notice, it would come the next time exactly
  upon the Fly's back: But, if this hapn'd not to be within a competent
  leap, then would this Insect move so softly, as the very shadow of the
  Gnomon seem'd not to be more imperceptible, unless the Fly mov'd; and
  then would the Spider move also in the same proportion, keeping that just
  time with her motion, as if the same Soul had animated both those little
  bodies; and whether it were forwards, backwards, or to either side,
  without at all turning her body, like a well mannag'd Horse: But, if the
  capricious Fly took wing, and pitch'd upon another place behind our
  Huntress, then would the Spider whirle its body so nimbly about, as
  nothing could be imagin'd more swift; by which means, she always kept the
  head towards her prey, though to appearance, as immovable, as if it had
  been a Nail driven into the Wood, till by that indiscernable progress
  (being arriv'd within the sphere of her reach) she made a fatal leap
  (swift as Lightning) upon the Fly, catching him in the pole, where she
  never quitted hold till her belly was full, and then carried the
  remainder home. I have beheld them instructing their young ones, how to
  hunt, which they would sometimes discipline for not well observing; but,
  when any of the old ones did (as sometimes) miss a leap, they would run
  out of the field, and hide them in their crannies, as asham'd, and haply
  not be seen abroad for four or five hours after; for so long have I
  watched the nature of this strange Insect, the contemplation of whose so
  wonderfull sagacity and address has amaz'd me; nor do I find in any chase
  whatsoever, more cunning and Stratagem observ'd: I have found some of
  these Spiders in my Garden, when the weather (towards the Spring)
  is very hot, but they are nothing so eager
  of hunting as they are in <i>Italy</i>.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There are multitudes of other sorts of Spiders, whose eyes, and most
  other parts and properties, are so exceedingly different both from those
  I have describ'd, and from one another, that it would be almost endless,
  at least too long for my present Essay, to describe them, as some with
  six eyes, plac'd in quite another order; others with eight eyes; others
  with fewer, and some with more. They all seem to be creatures of prey,
  and to feed on other small Insects, but their ways of catching them seem
  very differing: the Shepherd Spider by running on his prey; the Hunting
  Spider by leaping on it, other sorts weave Nets, or Cobwebs, whereby they
  ensnare them, Nature having both fitted them with materials and tools,
  and taught them how to work and weave their Nets, and to lie perdue, and
  to watch diligently to run on any Fly, as soon as ever entangled.</p>

  <p>Their thread or web seems to be spun out of some viscous kind of
  excrement, lying in their belly, which, though soft when drawn out, is,
  presently by reason of its smallness, hardned and dried by the ambient
  Air. Examining several of which with my <i>Microscope</i>, I found them
  to appear much like white Hors-hair, or some such transparent horny
  substance, and to be of very differing magnitudes; some appearing as bigg
  as a Pigg's brisle, others equal to a Horss-hair; other no bigger then a
  man's hair; others yet smaller and finer. I observ'd further, that the
  radiating chords of the web were much bigger, and smoother then those
  that were woven round, which seem'd smaller, and all over knotted or
  pearl'd, with small transparent Globules, not unlike small Crystal Beads
  or seed Pearls, thin strung on a Clew of Silk; which, whether they were
  so spun by the Spider, or by the adventitious moisture of a fogg (which I
  have observ'd to cover all these filaments with such Crystalline Beads) I
  will not now dispute.</p>

  <p>These threads were some of them so small, that I could very plainly,
  with the <i>Microscope</i>, discover the same consecutions of colours as
  in a <i>Prisme</i>, and they seem'd to proceed from the same cause with
  those colours which I have already describ'd in thin plated bodies.</p>

  <p>Much resembling a Cobweb, or a confus'd lock of these Cylinders, is a
  certain white substance which, after a fogg, may be observ'd to fly up
  and down the Air; catching several of these, and examining them with my
  <i>Microscope</i>, I found them to be much of the same form, looking most
  like to a flake of Worsted prepar'd to be spun, though by what means they
  should be generated, or produc'd, is not easily imagined: they were of
  the same weight, or very little heavier then the Air; and 'tis not
  unlikely, but that those great white clouds, that appear all the Summer
  time, may be of the same substance.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsXLIX" id="obsXLIX">XLIX</a>. <i>Of an </i>Ant<i> or </i>Pismire<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>This was a creature, more troublesom to be drawn, then any of the
  rest, for I could not, for a good while, think of a way to make it suffer
  its body to ly quiet in a natural posture; but whil'st it was alive, if
  its feet were fetter'd in Wax or Glew, it would so twist and wind its
  body, that I could not any wayes get a good view of it; and if I killed
  it, its body was so little, that I did often spoile the shape of it,
  before I could throughly view it: for this is the nature of these minute
  Bodies, that as soon, almost, as ever their life is destroy'd, their
  parts immediately shrivel, and lose their beauty; and so is it also with
  small Plants, as I instanced before, in the description of Moss. And
  thence also is the reason of the variations in the beards of wild Oats,
  and in those of Musk-grass seed, that their bodies, being exceeding
  small, those small variations which are made in the surfaces of all
  bodies, almost upon every change of Air, especially if the body be
  porous, do here become sensible, where the whole body is so small, that
  it is almost nothing but surface; for as in vegetable substances, I see
  no great reason to think, that the moisture of the Aire (that, sticking
  to a wreath'd beard, does make it untwist) should evaporate, or exhale
  away, any faster then the moisture of other bodies, but rather that the
  avolation from, or access of moisture to, the surfaces of bodies being
  much the same, those bodies become most sensible of it, which have the
  least proportion of body to their surface. So is it also with Animal
  substances; the dead body of an Ant, or such little creature, does almost
  instantly shrivel and dry, and your object shall be quite another thing,
  before you can half delineate it, which proceeds not from the
  extraordinary exhalation, but from the small proportion of body and
  juices, to the usual drying of bodies in the Air, especially if warm. For
  which inconvenience, where I could not otherwise remove it, I thought of
  this expedient.</p>

  <p>I took the creature, I had design'd to delineate, and put it into a
  drop of very well rectified spirit of Wine, this I found would presently
  dispatch, as it were, the Animal, and being taken out of it, and lay'd on
  a paper, the spirit of Wine would immediately fly away, and leave the
  Animal dry, in its natural posture, or at least, in a constitution, that
  it might easily with a pin be plac'd, in what posture you desired to draw
  it, and the limbs would so remain, without either moving, or shriveling.
  And thus I dealt with this Ant, which I have here delineated, which was
  one of many, of a very large kind, that inhabited under the Roots of a
  Tree, from whence they would sally out in great parties, and make most
  grievous havock of the Flowers and Fruits, in the ambient Garden, and
  return back again very expertly, by the same wayes and paths they
  went.</p>

  <p>It was more then half the bigness of an Earwig, of a dark brown, or
  reddish colour, with long legs, on the hinder of which it would stand
  up, and raise its head as high as it could
  above the ground, that it might stare the further about it, just after
  the same manner as I have also observ'd a hunting Spider to do: and
  putting my finger towards them, they have at first all run towards it,
  till almost at it; and then they would stand round about it, at a certain
  distance, and smell, as it were, and consider whether they should any of
  them venture any further, till one more bold then the rest venturing to
  climb it, all the rest, if I would have suffered them, would have
  immediately followed: many such other seemingly rational actions I have
  observ'd in this little Vermine with much pleasure, which would be too
  long to be here related; those that desire more of them may satisfie
  their curiosity in <i>Ligons</i> History of the <i>Barbadoes</i>.</p>

  <p>Having insnar'd several of these into a small Box, I made choice of
  the tallest grown among them, and separating it from the rest, I gave it
  a Gill of Brandy, or Spirit of Wine, which after a while e'en knock'd him
  down dead drunk, so that he became moveless, though at first putting in
  he struggled for a pretty while very much, till at last, certain bubbles
  issuing out of its mouth, it ceased to move; this (because I had before
  found them quickly to recover again, if they were taken out presently) I
  suffered to lye above an hour in the Spirit; and after I had taken it
  out, and put its body and legs into a natural posture, remained moveless
  about an hour; but then, upon a sudden, as if it had been awaken out of a
  drunken sleep, it suddenly reviv'd and ran away; being caught, and serv'd
  as before, he for a while continued struggling and striving, till at last
  there issued several bubbles out of its mouth, and then, <i>tanquam
  animam expirasset</i>, he remained moveless for a good while; but at
  length again recovering, it was again redipt, and suffered to lye some
  hours in the Spirit; notwithstanding which, after it had layen dry some
  three or four hours, it again recovered life and motion: Which kind of
  Experiments, if prosecuted, which they highly deserve, seem to me of no
  inconsiderable use towards the invention of the <i>Latent Scheme</i>, (as
  the Noble <i>Verulam</i> calls it) or the hidden, unknown Texture of
  Bodies.</p>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-32.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 32.</a>
</span>
  <p>Of what Figure this Creature appear'd through the <i>Microscope</i>,
  the 32. <i>Scheme</i> (though not so carefully graven as it ought) will
  represent to the eye, namely, That it had a large head AA, at the upper
  end of which were two protuberant eyes, pearl'd like those of a Fly, but
  smaller BB; out of the Nose, or foremost part, issued two horns CC, of a
  shape sufficiently differing from those of a blew Fly, though indeed they
  seem to be both the same kind of Organ, and to serve for a kind of
  smelling; beyond these were two indented jaws DD, which he open'd
  side-wayes, and was able to gape them asunder very wide; and the ends of
  them being armed with teeth, which meeting went between each other, it
  was able to grasp and hold a heavy body, three or four times the bulk and
  weight of its own body: It had only six legs, shap'd like those of a Fly,
  which, as I shewed before, is an Argument that it is a winged Insect, and
  though I could not perceive any sign of them in the middle part of its
  body (which seem'd to consist of three joints or pieces
  EFG, out of which sprung two legs), yet 'tis known that there are of them
  that have long wings, and fly up and down in the air.</p>

  <p>The third and last part of its body III was bigger and larger then the
  other two, unto which it was joyn'd by a very small middle, and had a
  kind of loose shell, or another distinct part of its body H, which seem'd
  to be interpos'd, and to keep the <i>thorax</i> and belly from
  touching.</p>

  <p>The whole body was cas'd over with a very strong armour, and the belly
  III was covered likewise with multitudes of small white shining brisles;
  the legs, horns, head, and middle parts of its body were bestuck with
  hairs also, but smaller and darker.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsL" id="obsL">L</a>. <i>Of the wandring </i>Mite<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>In <i>September</i> and <i>October, 1661.</i> I observ'd in
  <i>Oxford</i> several of these little pretty Creatures to wander to and
  fro, and often to travel over the plains of my Window. And in
  <i>September</i> and <i>October, 1663.</i> I observ'd likewise several of
  these very same Creatures traversing a window at <i>London</i>, and
  looking without the window upon the subjacent wall, I found whole flocks
  of the same kind running to and fro among the small groves and thickets
  of green moss, and upon the curiously spreading vegetable blew or yellow
  moss, which is a kind of a Mushrome or Jews-ear.</p>

  <p>These Creatures to the naked eye seemed to be a kind of black Mite,
  but much nimbler and stronger then the ordinary Cheese-Mites; but
  examining them in a <i>Microscope</i>, I found them to be a very fine
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-33.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 33.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 1.
</span>
  crusted or shell'd Insect, much like that represented in the first Figure
  of the three and thirtieth <i>Scheme</i>, with a protuberant oval shell
  A, indented or pitted with an abundance of small pits, all covered over
  with little white brisles, whose points all directed backwards.</p>

  <p>It had eight legs, each of them provided with a very sharp tallon, or
  claw at the end, which this little Animal, in its going, fastned into the
  pores of the body over which it went. Each of these legs were bestuck in
  every joynt of them with multitudes of small hairs, or (if we respect the
  proportion they bore to the bigness of the leg) turnpikes, all pointing
  towards the claws.</p>

  <p>The <i>Thorax</i>, or middle parts of the body of this Creature, was
  exceeding small, in respect both of the head and belly, it being nothing
  but that part which was covered by the two shells BB, though it seem'd to
  grow thicker underneath: And indeed, if we consider the great variety
  Nature uses in proportioning the three parts of the body, (the
  <i>Head</i>, <i>Thorax</i>, and <i>Belly</i>) we shall not wonder at the
  small proportion of this <i>Thorax</i>, nor at the vaster bulk of the
  belly, for could we exactly anatomise this little Creature, and observe
  the particular designs of each part, we should doubtless, as we do in all
  her more manageable and tractable fabricks, find
  much more reason to admire the excellency of her contrivance and
  workmanship, then to wonder, it was not made otherwise.</p>

  <p>The head of this little Insect was shap'd somewhat like a Mite's, that
  is, it had a long snout, in the manner of a Hogs, with a knobbed ridge
  running along the middle of it, which was bestuck on either side with
  many small brisles, all pointing forward, and two very large pikes or
  horns, which rose from the top of the head, just over each eye, and
  pointed forward also. It had two pretty large black eyes on either side
  of the head EE, from one of which I could see a very bright reflection of
  the window, which made me ghess, that the <i>Cornea</i> of it was smooth,
  like those of bigger Insects. Its motion was pretty quick and strong, it
  being able very easily to tumble a stone or clod four times as big as its
  whole body.</p>

  <p>At the same time and place, and divers times since, I have observed
  with my <i>Microscope</i>, another little Insect, which, though I have
  not annexed the picture of, may be worth noting, for its exceeding
  nimbleness as well as smalness; it was as small as a Mite, with a body
  deep and ridged, almost like a Flea; it had eight blood-red legs, not
  very long, but slender; and two horns or feelers before. Its motion was
  so exceeding quick, that I have often lost sight of one I have observed
  with my naked eye; and though, when it was not frighted, I was able to
  follow the motions of some with my <i>Microscope</i>; yet if it were
  never so little startled, it posted away with such speed, and turn'd and
  winded it self so quick, that I should presently lose sight of it.</p>

  <p>When I first observ'd the former of these Insects, or Mites, I began
  to conjecture, that certainly I had found out the vagabond Parents of
  those Mites we find in Cheeses, Meal, Corn, Seeds, musty Barrels, musty
  Leather, &amp;c. these little Creatures, wandring to and fro every
  whither, might perhaps, as they were invited hither and thither by the
  musty steams of several putrifying bodies, make their invasions upon
  those new and pleasing territories, and there spending the remainder of
  their life, which might be perhaps a day, or thereabouts, in very
  plentiful and riotous living, might leave their off-spring behind them,
  which by the change of the soil and Country they now inhabite, might be
  quite alter'd from the hew of their <i>primogenitors</i>, and, like
  <i>Mores</i> translated into Northern <i>European</i> Climates, after a
  little time, change both their skin and shape. And this seems yet more
  probable in these Insects, because that the soil or body they inhabit,
  seems to be almost half their parent, for it not only hatches and brings
  those little eggs, or seminal principles, to perfection, but seems to
  augment and nourish them also before they are hatch'd or shaped; for it
  is obvious enough to be observ'd, that the eggs of many other Insects,
  and particularly of Mites, are increas'd in bulk after they are laid out
  of the bodies of the Insects, and plump'd sometimes into many times their
  former bigness, so that the bodies they are laid in being, as it were,
  half their mothers, we shall not wonder that it should have such an
  active power to change their forms. We find by relations
  how much the <i>Negro</i> Women do besmeer the of-spring of the
  <i>Spaniard</i>, bringing forth neither white-skinn'd nor black, but
  tawny hided <i>Mulattos</i>.</p>

  <p>Now, though I propound this as probable, I have not yet been so farr
  certify'd by Observations as to conclude any thing, either positively or
  negatively, concerning it. Perhaps, some more lucky diligence may please
  the curious Inquirer with the discovery of this, to be a truth, which I
  now conjecture, and may thereby give him a satisfactory account of the
  cause of those creatures, whose original seems yet to obscure, and may
  give him cause to believe, that many other animate beings, that seem also
  to be the mere product of putrifaction, may be innobled with a Pedigree
  as ancient as the first creation, and farr exceed the greatest beings in
  their numerous Genealogies. But on the other side, if it should be found
  that these, or any other animate body, have no immediate similar Parent,
  I have in another place set down a conjectural <i>Hypothesis</i> whereby
  those <i>Phænomena</i> may likely enough be solv'd, wherein the infinite
  wisdom and providence of the Creator is no less rare and wonderfull.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsLI" id="obsLI">LI</a>. <i>Of the </i>Crab-like<i> Insect.</i></h3>

  <p>Reading one day in <i>Septemb.</i> I chanced to observe a very smal
  creature creep over the Book I was reading, very slowly; having a
  <i>Microscope</i> by me, I observ'd it to be a creature of a very unusual
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-33.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 33.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 2.
</span>
  form, and that not less notable; such as is describ'd in the second
  <i>Figure</i> of the 33. <i>Scheme</i>. It was about the bigness of a
  large Mite, or somewhat longer, it had ten legs, eight of which, AAAA,
  were topt with very sharp claws, and were those upon which he walk'd,
  seeming shap'd much like those of a Crab, which in many other things also
  this little creature resembled; for the two other claws, BB, which were
  the formost of all the ten, and seem'd to grow out of his head, like the
  horns of other Animals, were exactly form'd in the manner of Crabs or
  Lobsters claws, for they were shap'd and jointed much like those
  represented in the <i>Scheme</i> and the ends of them were furnish'd with
  a pair of claws or pincers, CC, which this little animal did open and
  shut at pleasure: It seem'd to make use of those two horns or claws both
  for feelers and holders; for in its motion it carried these aloft
  extended before, moving them to and fro, just as a man blindfolded would
  do his hands when he is fearfull of running against a wall, and if I put
  a hair to it, it would readily take hold of it with these claws, and seem
  to hold it fast. Now, though these horns seem'd to serve him for two
  uses, namely, for feeling and holding; yet he seem'd neither blind,
  having two small black spots, DD, which by the make of them, and the
  bright reflection from them seem'd to be his eyes, nor did it want other
  hands, having another pair of claws, EE, very neer plac'd to its mouth,
  and seem'd adjoining to it.</p>

  <p>The whole body was cased over with armour-shells, as is usuall in all
  those kinds of <i>crustaceous</i>
  creatures, especially about their bellies, and seem'd of three kinds, the
  head F seem'd cover'd with a kind of scaly shell, the <i>thorax</i> with
  two smooth shells, or Rings, GG, and the belly with eight knobb'd ones. I
  could not certainly find whether it had under these last shells any
  wings, but I suspect the contrary; for I have not found any wing'd Insect
  with eight leggs, two of those leggs being always converted into wings,
  and, for the most part, those that have but six, have wings.</p>

  <p>This creature, though I could never meet with more then one of them,
  and so could not make so many examinations of it as otherwise I would, I
  did notwithstanding, by reason of the great curiosity that appear'd to me
  in its shape, delineate it, to shew that, in all likelihood, Nature had
  crouded together into this very minute Insect, as many, and as excellent
  contrivances, as into the body of a very large Crab, which exceeds it in
  bulk, perhaps, some Millions of times; for as to all the apparent parts,
  there is a greater rather then a less multiplicity of parts, each legg
  has as many parts, and as many joints as a Crabs, nay, and as many hairs
  or brisles; and the like may be in all the other visible parts; and 'tis
  very likely, that the internal curiosities are not less excellent: It
  being a general rule in Nature's proceedings, that where she begins to
  display any excellency, if the subject be further search'd into, it will
  manifest, that there is not less curiosity in those parts which our
  single eye cannot reach, then in those which are more obvious.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsLII" id="obsLII">LII</a>. <i>Of the small Silver-colour'd </i>Book-worm<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>As among greater Animals there are many that are scaled, both for
  ornament and defence, so are there not wanting such also among the lesser
  bodies of Insects, whereof this little creature gives us an Instance. It
  is a small white Silver-shining Worm or Moth, which I found much
  conversant among Books and Papers, and is suppos'd to be that which
  corrodes and eats holes through the leaves and covers; it appears to the
  naked eye, a small glittering Pearl-colour'd Moth, which upon the
  removing of Books and Papers in the Summer, is often observ'd very nimbly
  to scud, and pack away to some lurking cranney, where it may the better
  protect itself from any appearing dangers. Its head appears bigg and
  blunt, and its body tapers from it towads the tail, smaller and smaller,
  being shap'd almost like a Carret.</p>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-33.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 33.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 3.
</span>
  <p>This the <i>Microscopical</i> appearance will more plainly manifest,
  which exhibits, in the third <i>Figure</i> of the 33. <i>Scheme</i>, a
  conical body, divided into fourteen several partitions, being the
  appearance of so many several shels, or shields that cover the whole
  body, every of these shells are again cover'd or tiled over with a
  multitude of thin transparent scales, which, from the multiplicity of
  their reflecting surfaces, make the whole Animal appear of a perfect
  Pearl-colour.</p>

  <p>Which, by the way, may hint us the reason of that so much admired
  appearance of those so highly esteem'd bodies, as also of the like in
  mother of Pearl-shells, and in multitudes of other shelly Sea-substances;
  for they each of them consisting of an infinite number of very thin
  shells or laminated orbiculations, cause such multitudes of reflections,
  that the compositions of them together with the reflections of others
  that are so thin as to afford colours (of which I elsewhere give the
  reason) gives a very pleasant reflection of light. And that this is the
  true cause, seems likely, first, because all those so appearing bodies
  are compounded of multitudes of plated substances. And next that, by
  ordering any trasparent substance after this manner, the like
  <i>Phænomena</i> may be produc'd; this will be made very obvious by the
  blowing of Glass into exceeding thin shells, and then breaking them into
  scales, which any lamp-worker will presently do; for a good quantity of
  these scales, laid in a heap together, have much the same resemblance of
  Pearls. Another way, not less instructive and pleasant, is a way which I
  have several times done, which is by working and tossing, as 'twere, a
  parcel of pure crystalline glass whilst it is kept glowing hot in the
  blown flame of a Lamp, for, by that means, that purely transparent body
  will be so divided into an infinite number of plates, or small strings,
  with interpos'd aerial plates and <i>fibres</i>, that from the
  multiplicity of the reflections from each of those internal surfaces, it
  may be drawn out into curious Pearl-like or Silver wire, which though
  small, will yet be opacous; the same thing I have done with a composition
  of red <i>Colophon</i> and <i>Turpentine</i>, and a little Bee's Wax, and
  may be done likewise with Birdlime, and such like glutinous and
  transparent bodies: But to return to our description.</p>

  <p>The small blunt head of this Insect was furnish'd on either side of it
  with a cluster of eyes, each of which seem'd to contain but a very few,
  in comparison of what I had observ'd the clusters of other Insects to
  abound with; each of these clusters were beset with a row of small
  brisles, much like the <i>cilia</i> or hairs on the eye-lids, and,
  perhaps, they serv'd for the same purpose. It had two long horns before,
  which were streight, and tapering towards the top, curiously ring'd or
  knobb'd, and brisled much like the Marsh Weed, call'd Horse-tail, or
  Cats-tail, having at each knot a fring'd Girdle, as I may so call it, of
  smaller hairs, and several bigger and larger brisles, here and there
  dispers'd among them: besides these, it had two shorter horns, or
  feelers, which were knotted and fring'd, just as the former, but wanted
  brisles, and were blunt at the ends; the hinder part of the creature was
  terminated with three tails, in every particular resembling the two
  longer horns that grew out of the head: The leggs of it were scal'd and
  hair'd much like the rest, but are not express'd in this <i>Figure</i>,
  the Moth being intangled all in Glew, and so the leggs of this appear'd
  not through the Glass which looked perpendicularly upon the back.</p>

  <p>This Animal probably feeds upon the Paper and covers of Books, and
  perforates in them several small round holes, finding, perhaps, a
  convenient nourishment in those hulks of Hemp and Flax, which have pass'd
  through so many scourings, washings,
  dressings and dryings, as the parts of old Paper must necessarily have
  suffer'd; the digestive faculty, it seems, of these little creatures
  being able yet further to work upon those stubborn parts, and reduce them
  into another form.</p>

  <p>And indeed, when I consider what a heap of Saw-dust or chips this
  little creature (which is one of the teeth of Time) conveys into its
  intrals, I cannot chuse but remember and admire the excellent contrivance
  of Nature, in placing in Animals such a fire, as is continually nourished
  and supply'd by the materials convey'd into the stomach, and
  <i>fomented</i> by the bellows of the lungs; and in so contriving the
  most admirable fabrick of Animals, as to make the very spending and
  wasting of that fire, to be instrumental to the procuring and collecting
  more materials to augment and cherish it self, which indeed seems to be
  the principal end of all the contrivances observable in bruit
  Animals.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsLIII" id="obsLIII">LIII</a>. <i>Of a </i>Flea<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>The strength and beauty of this small creature, had it no other
  relation at all to man, would deserve a description.</p>

  <p>For its strength, the <i>Microscope</i> is able to make no greater
  discoveries of it then the naked eye, but onely the curious contrivance
  of its leggs and joints, for the exerting that strength, is very plainly
  manifested, such as no other creature, I have yet observ'd, has any thing
  like it; for the joints of it are so adapted, that he can, as 'twere,
  fold them short one within another, and suddenly stretch, or spring them
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-34.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 34.</a>
</span>
  out to their whole length, that is, of the fore-leggs, the part A, of the
  34. <i>Scheme</i>, lies within B, and B within C, parallel to, or side by
  side each other; but the parts of the two next, lie quite contrary, that
  is, D without E, and E without F, but parallel also; but the parts of the
  hinder leggs, G, H and I, bend one within another, like the parts of a
  double jointed Ruler, or like the foot, legg and thigh of a man; these
  six leggs he clitches up altogether, and when he leaps, springs them all
  out, and thereby exerts his whole strength at once.</p>

  <p>But, as for the beauty of it, the <i>Microscope</i> manifests it to be
  all over adorn'd with a curiously polish'd suit of <i>sable</i> Armour,
  neatly jointed, and beset with multitudes of sharp pinns, shap'd almost
  like Porcupine's Quills, or bright conical Steel-bodkins; the head is on
  either side beautify'd with a quick and round black eye K, behind each of
  which also appears a small cavity, L, in which he seems to move to and
  fro a certain thin film beset with many small transparent hairs, which
  probably may be his ears; in the forepart of his head, between the two
  fore-leggs, he has two small long jointed feelers, or rather smellers,
  MM, which have four joints, and are hairy, like those of several other
  creatures; between these, it has a small <i>proboscis</i>, or
  <i>probe</i>, NNO, that seems to consist of a tube NN,
  and a tongue or sucker O, which I have perceiv'd him to slip in and out.
  Besides these, it has also two chaps or biters PP, which are somewhat
  like those of an Ant, but I could not perceive them tooth'd; these were
  shap'd very like the blades of a pair of round top'd Scizers, and were
  opened and shut just after the same manner; with these Instruments does
  this little busie Creature bite and pierce the skin, and suck out the
  blood of an Animal, leaving the skin inflamed with a small round red
  spot. These parts are very difficult to be discovered, because, for the
  most part, they lye covered between the fore-legs. There are many other
  particulars, which, being more obvious, and affording no great matter of
  information, I shall pass by, and refer the Reader to the Figure.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsLIV" id="obsLIV">LIV</a>. <i>Of a Louse.</i></h3>

  <p>This is a Creature so officious, that 'twill be known to every one at
  one time or other, so busie, and so impudent, that it will be intruding
  it self in every ones company, and so proud and aspiring withall, that it
  fears not to trample on the best, and affects nothing so much as a Crown;
  feeds and lives very high, and that makes it so saucy, as to pull any one
  by the ears that comes in its way, and will never be quiet till it has
  drawn blood: it is troubled at nothing so much as at a man that scratches
  his head, as knowing that man is plotting and contriving some mischief
  against it, and that makes it oftentime sculk into some meaner and lower
  place, and run behind a mans back, though it go very much against the
  hair; which ill conditions of it having made it better known then
  trusted, would exempt me from making any further description of it, did
  not my faithful <i>Mercury</i>, my <i>Microscope</i>, bring me other
  information of it. For this has discovered to me, by means of a very
  bright light cast on it, that it is a Creature of a very odd shape; it
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-35.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 35.</a>
</span>
  has a head shap'd like that exprest in 35. <i>Scheme</i> marked with A,
  which seems almost Conical, but is a little flatted on the upper and
  under sides, at the biggest part of which, on either side behind the head
  (as it were, being the place where other Creatures ears stand) are placed
  its two black shining goggle eyes BB, looking backwards, and fenced round
  with several small <i>cilia</i>, or hairs that incompass it, so that it
  seems this Creature has no very good foresight: It does not seem to have
  any eye-lids, and therefore perhaps its eyes were so placed, that it
  might the better cleanse them with its fore-legs; and perhaps this may be
  the reason, why they so much avoid and run from the light behind them,
  for being made to live in the shady and dark recesses of the hair, and
  thence probably their eye having a great aperture, the open and clear
  light, especially that of the Sun, must needs very much offend them; to
  secure these eyes from receiving any injury from the hairs through which
  it passes, it has two horns that grow before
  it, in the place where one would have thought the eyes should be; each of
  these CC hath four joynts, which are fringed, as 'twere, with small
  brisles, from which to the tip of its snout D, the head seems very round
  and tapering, ending in a very sharp nose D, which seems to have a small
  hole, and to be the passage through which he sucks the blood. Now whereas
  if it be plac'd on its back, with its belly upwards, as it is in the 35.
  <i>Scheme</i>, it seems in several Positions to have a resemblance of
  chaps, or jaws, as is represented in the Figure by EE, yet in other
  postures those dark strokes disappear; and having kept several of them in
  a box for two or three dayes, so that for all that time they had nothing
  to feed on, I found, upon letting one creep on my hand, that it
  immediately fell to sucking, and did neither seem to thrust its nose very
  deep into the skin, nor to open any kind of mouth, but I could plainly
  perceive a small current of blood, which came directly from its snout,
  and past into its belly; and about A there seem'd a contrivance, somewhat
  resembling a Pump, pair of Bellows, or Heart, for by a very swift
  <i>systole</i> and <i>diastole</i> the blood seem'd drawn from the nose,
  and forced into the body. It did not seem at all, though I viewed it a
  good while as it was sucking, to thrust more of its nose into the skin
  then the very snout D, nor did it cause the least discernable pain, and
  yet the blood seem'd to run through its head very quick and freely, so
  that it seems there is no part of the skin but the blood is dispers'd
  into, nay, even into the <i>cuticula</i>; for had it thrust its whole
  nose in from D to CC, it would not have amounted to the supposed
  thickness of that <i>tegument</i>, the length of the nose being not more
  then a three hundredth part of an inch. It has six legs, covered with a
  very transparent shell, and joynted exactly like a Crab's, or Lobster's;
  each leg is divided into six parts by these joynts, and those have here
  and there several small hairs; and at the end of each leg it has two
  claws, very properly adapted for its peculiar use, being thereby inabled
  to walk very securely both on the skin and hair; and indeed this
  contrivance of the feet is very curious, and could not be made more
  commodiously and compendiously, for performing both these requisite
  motions, of walking and climbing up the hair of a mans head, then it is:
  for, by having the lesser claw (a) set so much short of the bigger (b)
  when it walks on the skin the shorter touches not, and then the feet are
  the same with those of a Mite, and several other small Insects, but by
  means of the small joynts of the longer claw it can bend it round, and so
  with both claws take hold of a hair, in the manner represented in the
  Figure, the long transparent Cylinder FFF, being a Man's hair held by
  it.</p>

  <p>The <i>Thorax</i> seem'd cas'd with another kind of substance then the
  belly, namely, with a thin transparent horny substance, which upon the
  fasting of the Creature did not grow flaccid; through this I could
  plainly see the blood, suck'd from my hand, to be variously distributed,
  and mov'd to and fro; and about G there seem'd a pretty big white
  substance, which seem'd to be moved within its <i>thorax</i>; besides,
  there appear'd very many small milk-white vessels, which crost over the
  breast between the legs, out of which, on either
  side, were many small branchings, these seem'd to be the veins and
  arteries, for that which is analogus to blood in all Insects is
  milk-white.</p>

  <p>The belly is covered with a transparent substance likewise, but more
  resembling a skin then a shell, for 'tis grain'd all over the belly just
  like the skin in the palms of a man's hand, and when the belly is empty,
  grows very flaccid and wrinkled; at the upper end of this is placed the
  stomach HH, and perhaps also the white spot II may be the liver or
  <i>pancreas</i>, which, by the <i>peristalick</i> motion of the guts, is
  a little mov'd to and fro, not with a <i>systole</i> and <i>diastole</i>,
  but rather with a thronging or justling motion. Viewing one of these
  Creatures, after it had fasted two dayes, all the hinder part was lank
  and flaccid, and the white spot II hardly mov'd, most of the white
  branchings disappear'd, and most also of the redness or sucked blood in
  the guts, the <i>peristaltick</i> motion of which was scarce discernable;
  but upon the suffering it to suck, it presently fill'd the skin of the
  belly, and of the six scolop'd embosments on either side, as full as it
  could be stuft, the stomach and guts were as full as they could hold; the
  <i>peristaltick</i> motion of the gut grew quick, and the justling motion
  of II accordingly; multitudes of milk-white vessels seem'd quickly
  filled, and turgid, which were perhaps the veins and arteries and the
  Creature was so greedy, that though it could not contain more, yet it
  continued sucking as fast as ever, and as fast emptying it self behind:
  the digestion of this Creature must needs be very quick, for though I
  perceiv'd the blood thicker and blacker when suck'd, yet, when in the
  guts, it was of a very lovely ruby colour, and that part of it, which was
  digested into the veins, seemed white; whence it appears, that a further
  digestion of blood may make it milk, at least of a resembling colour:
  What is else observable in the figure of this Creature, may be seen by
  the 35. <i>Scheme</i>.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsLV" id="obsLV">LV</a>. <i>Of </i>Mites<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>The least of <i>Reptiles</i> I have hitherto met with, is a Mite, a
  Creature whereof there are some so very small, that the sharpest sight,
  unassisted with Glasses, is not able to discern them, though, being white
  of themselves, they move on a black and smooth surface; and the Eggs, out
  of which these Creatures seem to be hatch'd, are yet smaller, those being
  usually not above a four or five hundredth part of a well grown Mite, and
  those well grown Mites not much above one hundredth of an inch in
  thickness; so that according to this reckoning there may be no less then
  a million of well grown Mites contain'd in a cubick inch, and five
  hundred times as many Eggs.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding which minuteness a good <i>Microscope</i> discovers
  those small movable specks to be very prettily shap'd Insects, each of
  them furnished with eight well shap'd and proportion'd
  legs, which are each of them joynted or bendable in eight several places,
  or joynts, each of which is covered, for the most part, with a very
  transparent shell, and the lower end of the shell of each joynt is
  fringed with several small hairs; the contrivance of the joynts seems the
  very same with that of Crabs and Lobsters legs, and like those also, they
  are each of them terminated with a very sharp claw or point; four of
  these legs are so placed, that they seem to draw forwards, the other four
  are placed in a quite contrary position, thereby to keep the body
  backwards when there is occasion.</p>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-36.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 36.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 1.
</span>
  <p>The body, as in other larger Insects, consists of three regions or parts; the
  hinder or belly A, seems covered with one intire shell, the middle, or
  chest, seems divided into two shells BC. which running one within the
  other, the Mite is able to shrink in and thrust out as it finds occasion,
  as it can also the snout D. The whole body is pretty transparent, so that
  being look'd on against the light, divers motions within its body may be
  perceived; as also all the parts are much more plainly delineable, then
  in other postures, to the light. The shell, especially that which covers
  the back, is curiously polisht, so that 'tis easie to see, as in a
  <i>convex</i> Looking-glass, or <i>foliated</i> Glass-ball, the picture
  of all the objects round about; up and down, in several parts of its
  body, it has several small long white hairs growing out of its shell,
  which are often longer then the whole body, and are represented too short
  in the first and second Figures; they seem all pretty straight and
  plyable, save only two upon the fore-part of its body, which seem to be
  the horns, as may be seen in the Figures; the first whereof is a prospect
  of a smaller sort of Mites (which are usually more plump) as it was
  <i>passant</i> to and fro; the second is the prospect of one fixt on its
  tail (by means of a little mouth-glew rub'd on the object plate)
  exhibiting the manner of the growing of the legs, together with their
  several joynts.</p>

  <p>This Creature is very much diversify'd in shape, colour, and divers
  other properties, according to the nature of the substance out of which
  it seems to be ingendred and nourished, being in one substance more long,
  in another more round, in some more hairy, in others more smooth, in this
  nimble, in that slow, here pale and whiter, there browner, blacker, more
  transparent, <i>&amp;c.</i> I have observed it to be resident almost on
  all kinds of substances that are mouldy, or putrifying, and have seen it
  very nimbly meshing through the thickets of mould, and sometimes to lye
  <i>dormant</i> underneath them; and 'tis not unlikely, but that it may
  feed on that vegetating substance, <i>spontaneous Vegetables</i> seeming
  a food proper enough for <i>spontaneous Animals</i>,</p>

  <p>But whether indeed this Creature, or any other, be such or not, I
  cannot positively, from any Experiment, or Observation, I have yet made,
  determine. But, as I formerly hinted, it seems probable, that some kind
  of wandring Mite may sow, as 'twere, the first seeds, or lay the first
  eggs, in those places, which Nature has instructed them to know
  convenient for the hatching and nourishing their young; and though
  perhaps the prime Parent might be of a shape very
  differing from what the offspring, after a little while, by reason of the
  substance they feed on, or the Region (as 'twere) they inhabite; yet
  perhaps even one of these alter'd progeny, wandering again from its
  native soil, and lighting on by chance the same place from whence its
  prime Parent came, and there settling, and planting, may produce a
  generation of Mites of the same shapes and properties with the first
  wandring Mite: And from some such accidents as these, I am very apt to
  think, the most sorts of Animals, generally accounted <i>spontaneous</i>,
  have their <i>origination</i>, and all those various sorts of Mites, that
  are to be met with up and down in divers putrifying substances, may
  perhaps be all of the same kind, and have sprung from one and the same
  sort of Mites at the first.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsLVI" id="obsLVI">LVI</a>. <i>Of a small Creature hatch'd on a Vine.</i></h3>

  <p>There is, almost all the Spring and Summer time, a certain small,
  round, white Cobweb, as 'twere, about the bigness of a Pea, which sticks
  very close and fast to the stocks of Vines nayl'd against a warm wall:
  being attentively viewed, they seem cover'd, upon the upper side of them,
  with a small husk, not unlike the scale, or shell of a Wood-louse, or
  Hog-louse, a small Insect usually found about rotten wood, which upon
  touching presently rouls it self into the form of a peppercorn:
  Separating several of these from the stock, I found them, with my
  <i>Microscope</i>, to consist of a shell, which now seemed more likely to
  be the husk of one of these Insects: And the fur seem'd a kind of cobweb,
  consisting of abundance of small filaments, or sleaves of cobwebs. In the
  midst of this, if they were not hatch'd, and run away before, the time of
  which hatching was usually about the latter end of <i>June</i>, or
  beginning of <i>July</i>, I have often found abundance of small brown

  head large, almost half the bigness of its body, which is usual in the
  <i>f&#339;tus</i> of most Creatures. It had two small black eyes
  <i>aa</i>, and two small long joynted and brisled horns <i>bb</i>. The
  hinder part of its body seem'd to consist of nine scales, and the last
  ended in a forked tayl, much like that of a <i>Cutio</i>, or Wood louse,
  out of which grew two long hairs; they ran to and fro very swiftly, and
  were much of the bigness of a common Mite, but some of them less: The
  longest of them seem'd not the hundredth part of an inch, and the Eggs
  usually not above half as much. They seemed to have six legs, which were
  not visible in this I have here delineated, by reason they were drawn
  under its body.</p>

  <p>If these Minute creatures were <i>Wood-lice</i> (as indeed from their
  own shape and from the frame, the skin, or shell, that grows on them, one
  may with great probability ghess) it affords us an
  Instance, whereof perhaps there are not many like in Nature, and that is,
  of the prodigious increase of these Creatures, after they are hatch'd and
  run about; for a common Wood-louse, of about half an inch long, is no
  less then a hundred and twenty five thousand times bigger then one of
  these, which though indeed it seems very strange, yet I have observed the
  young ones of some Spiders have almost kept the same proportion to their
  Dam.</p>

  <p>This, methinks, if it be so, does in the next place hint a Quæry,
  which may perhaps deserve a little further examination: And that is,
  Whether there be not many of those minute Creatures, such as Mites, and
  the like, which, though they are commonly thought of otherwise, are only
  the <i>pully</i>, or young ones, of much bigger Insects, and not the
  generating, or parent <i>Insect</i>, that has layd those Eggs; for having
  many times observ'd those Eggs, which usually are found in great
  abundance where Mites are found, it seems something strange, that so
  small an Animal should have an Egg so big in proportion to its body.
  Though on the other side, I must confess, that having kept divers of
  those Mites inclosed in a box for a good while, I did not find them very
  much augmented beyond their usual bigness.</p>

  <p>What the husk and cobweb of this little white substance should be, I
  cannot imagine, unless it be, that the old one, when impregnated with
  Eggs, should there stay, and fix it self on the Vine, and dye, and all
  the body by degrees should rot, save only the husk, and the Eggs in the
  body: And the heat, or fire, as it were, of the approaching Sun-beams
  should vivifie those Relicts of the corrupted Parent, and out of the
  ashes, as 'twere, (as it is fabled of the <i>Ph&#339;nix</i>) should
  raise a new <i>offspring</i> for the perpetuation of the <i>Species</i>.
  Nor will the cobweb, as it were, in which these Eggs are inclos'd, make
  much against this Conjecture; for we may, by those cobwebs that are
  carried up and down the Air after a Fog (which with my <i>Microscope</i>
  I have discovered to be made up of an infinite company of small filaments
  or threads) learn, that such a texture of body may be otherwise made then
  by the spinning of a Worm.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsLVII" id="obsLVII">LVII</a>. <i>Of the </i>Eels<i> in Vinegar.</i></h3>

  <p>Of these small Eels, which are to be found in divers sorts of Vinegar,
  I have little to add besides their Picture, which you may find drawn in
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-25.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 25.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 3.
</span>
  the third Figure of the 25. <i>Scheme</i>: That is, they were shaped much
  like an Eel, save only that their nose A, (which was a little more
  opacous then the rest of their body) was a little sharper, and longer, in
  proportion to their body, and the wrigling motion of their body seem'd to
  be onely upwards and downwards, whereas that of Eels is onely side wayes:
  They seem'd to have a more opacous part about B,
  which might, perhaps, be their Gills; it seeming always the same
  proportionate distant from their nose, from which, to the tip of their
  tail, C, their body seem'd to taper.</p>

  <p>Taking several of these out of their Pond of Vinegar, by the net of a
  small piece of filtring Paper, and laying them on a black smooth Glass
  plate, I found that they could wriggle and winde their body, as much
  almost as a Snake, which made me doubt, whether they were a kind of Eal
  or Leech.</p>

  <p>I shall add no other observations made on this minute Animal, being
  prevented herein by many excellent ones already publish'd by the
  ingenious, Doctor <i>Power</i>, among his <i>Microscopical</i>
  Observations, save onely that a quantity of Vinegar repleat with them
  being included in a small Viol, and stop'd very close from the ambient
  air, all the included Worms in a very short time died, as if they had
  been stifled.</p>

  <p>And that their motion seems (contrary to what we may observe in the
  motion of all other Infects) exceeding slow. But the reason of it seems
  plain, for being to move to and fro after that manner which they do, by
  waving onely, or wrigling their body; the tenacity, or glutinousness, and
  the density or resistance of the fluid <i>medium</i> becomes so exceeding
  sensible to their extremely minute bodies, that it is to me indeed a
  greater wonder that they move them so fast as they do, then that they
  move them no faster. For what a vastly greater proportion have they of
  their superficies to their bulk, then Eels or other larger Fishes, and
  next, the tenacity and density of the liquor being much the same to be
  moved, both by the one and the other, the resistance or impediment thence
  arising to the motions made through it, must be almost infinitely greater
  to the small one then to the great. This we find experimentally verify'd
  in the Air, which though a <i>medium</i> a thousand times more rarify'd
  then the water, the resistance of it to motions made through it, is yet
  so sensible to very minute bodies, that a Down-feather (the least of
  whose parts seem yet bigger then these Eels, and many of them almost
  incomparably bigger, such as the quill and stalk) is suspended by it, and
  carried to and fro as if it had no weight.</p>

transparent </i>Mediums<i> nam'd </i>Inflection<i>, whereby very many considerable
</i>Phænomena<i> are attempted to be solv'd, and divers other
uses are hinted.</i></h3>

  <p>Since the Invention (and perfecting in some measure) of
  <i>Telescopes</i>, it has been observ'd by several, that the Sun and Moon
  neer the Horizon, are disfigur'd (losing that exactly-smooth terminating
  circular limb, which they are observ'd to have when situated neerer the
  Zenith) and are bounded with an edge every way (especially upon the right
  and left sides) ragged and indented like a Saw:
  which inequality of their limbs, I have further observ'd, not to remain
  always the same, but to be continually chang'd by a kind of fluctuating
  motion, not unlike that of the waves of the Sea, so as that part of the
  limb, which was but even now nick'd or indented in, is now protuberant,
  and will presently be sinking again; neither is this all but the whole
  body of the Luminaries, do in the <i>Telescope</i>, seem to be depress'd
  and slatted, the upper, and more especially the under side appearing
  neerer to the middle then really they are, and the right and left
  appearing more remote: whence the whole <i>Area</i> seems to be
  terminated by a kind of Oval. It is further observ'd, that the body, for
  the most part, appears red, or of some colour approaching neer unto it,
  as some kind of yellow; and this I have always mark'd, that the more the
  limb is slatted or ovalled, the more red does the body appear, though not
  always the contrary. It is further observable, that both fix'd Stars and
  Planets, the neerer they appear to the Horizon, the more red and dull
  they look, and the more they are observ'd to twinkle; in so much, that I
  have seen the Dog-starr to vibrate so strong and bright a radiation of
  light, as almost to dazle my eyes, and presently, almost to disappear. It
  is also observable, that those bright scintillations neer the Horizon,
  are not by much so quick and sudden in their consecutions of one another,
  as the nimbler twinklings of Stars neerer the Zenith. This is also
  notable, that the Starrs neer the Horizon, are twinkled with several
  colours; so as sometimes to appear red, sometimes more yellow, and
  sometimes blue, and this when the Starr is a pretty way elevated above
  the Horizon. I have further, very often seen some of the small Starrs of
  the fifth or sixth magnitude, at certain times to disappear for a small
  moment of time, and again appear more conspicuous, and with a greater
  luster. I have several times, with my naked eye, seen many smaller
  Starrs, such as may be call'd of the seventh or eighth magnitude to
  appear for a short space, and then vanish, which, by directing a small
  <i>Telescope</i> towards that part they appear'd and disappear'd in; I
  could presently find to be indeed small Starrs so situate, as I had seen
  them with my naked eye, and to appear twinkling like the ordinary visible
  Stars; nay, in examining some very notable parts of the Heaven, with a
  three foot Tube, me thought I now and then, in several parts of the
  constellation, could perceive little twinklings of Starrs, making a very
  short kind of apparition, and presently vanishing, but noting diligently
  the places where they thus seem'd to play at boe-peep, I made use of a
  very good twelve foot Tube, and with that it was not uneasie to see
  those, and several other degrees of smaller Starrs, and some smaller yet,
  that seem'd again to appear and disappear, and these also by giving the
  same Object-glass a much bigger aperture, I could plainly and constantly
  see appear in their former places; so that I have observ'd some twelve
  several magnitudes of Starrs less then those of the six magnitudes
  commonly recounted in the Globes.</p>

  <p>It has been observ'd and confirm'd by the accuratest Observations of
  the best of our modern Astronomers, that all the Luminous bodies appear
  above the Horizon, when they really are below it. So that the
  Sun and Moon have both been seen above the
  Horizon, whil'st the Moon has been in an Eclipse. I shall not here
  instance in the great refractions, that the tops of high mountains, seen
  at a distance, have been found to have; all which seem to argue the
  Horizontal refraction, much greater then it is hitherto generally
  believ'd.</p>

  <p>I have further taken notice, that not onely the Sun, Moon and Starrs,
  and high tops of mountains have suffer'd these kinds of refraction, but
  Trees, and several bright Objects on the ground: I have often taken
  notice of the twinkling of the reflections of the Sun from a Glass-window
  at a good distance, and of a Candle in the night, but that is not so
  conspicuous, and in observing the setting Sun, I have often taken notice
  of the tremulation of the Trees and Bushes, as well as of the edges of
  the Sun. Divers of these <i>Phænomena</i> have been taken notice of by
  several, who have given several reasons of them, but I have not yet met
  with any altogether satisfactory, though some of their conjectures have
  been partly true, but partly also false. Setting my self therfore upon
  the inquiry of these <i>Phænomena</i>, I first endeavour'd to be very
  diligent in taking notice of the several particulars and circumstances
  observable in them; and next, in making divers particular Experiments,
  that might cleer some doubts, and serve to determine, confirm, and
  illustrate the true and adæquate cause of each; and upon the whole, I
  find much reason to think, that the true cause of all these
  <i>Phænomena</i> is from the <i>inflection</i>, or <i>multiplicate
  refraction</i> of those Rays of light within the body of the
  <i>Atmosphere</i>, and that it does not proceed from a <i>refraction</i>
  caus'd by any terminating <i>superficies</i> of the Air above, nor from
  any such exactly defin'd <i>superficies</i> within the body of the
  <i>Atmosphere</i>.</p>

  <p>This Conclusion is grounded upon these two Propositions:</p>

  <p>First, that a <i>medium</i>, whose parts are unequally <i>dense</i>,
  and mov'd by various motions and transpositions as to one another, will
  produce all these visible effects upon the Rays of light, without any
  other <i>coefficient</i> cause.</p>

  <p>Secondly, that there is in the Air or <i>Atmosphere</i> such a variety
  in the constituent parts of it, both as to their <i>density</i> and
  <i>rarity</i>, and as to their divers mutations and positions one to
  another.</p>

  <p>By <i>Density</i> and <i>Rarity</i>, I understand a property of a
  transparent body, that does either more or less refract a Ray of light
  (coming obliquely upon its superficies out of a third <i>medium</i>)
  toward its perpendicular: As I call Glass a more dense body then Water,
  and Water a more rare body then Glass, because of the refractions (more
  or less deflecting towards the perpendicular) that are made in them, of a
  Ray of light out of the Air that has the same inclination upon either of
  their superficies.</p>

  <p>So as to the business of Refraction, spirit of Wine is a more
  <i>dense</i> body then Water, it having been found by an accurate
  Instrument that measures the angles of Refractions to Minutes that for
  the same refracted angle of 30°.00'. in both those <i>Mediums</i>, the
  angle of incidence in Water was but 41°.35'. but the angle of the
  incidence in the trial with spirit of Wine was 42°.45'. But as to
  gravity, Water is a more <i>dense</i> body then spirit of
  Wine, for the proportion of the same Water, to the same very well
  rectify'd spirit of Wine was, as 21. to 19.</p>

  <p>So as to Refraction, Water is more Dense then Ice; for I have found by
  a most certain Experiment, which I exhibited before divers illustrious
  Persons of the <i>Royal Society</i>, that the Refraction of Water was
  greater then that of Ice, though some considerable Authors have affirm'd
  the contrary, and though the Ice be a very hard, and the Water a very
  fluid body.</p>

  <p>That the former of the two preceding Propositions is true, may be
  manifested by several Experiments; As first, if you take any two liquors
  differing from one another in density, but yet such as will readily mix:
  as Salt Water, or Brine, &amp; Fresh; almost any kind of Salt dissolv'd
  in Water, and filtrated, so that it be cleer, spirit of Wine and Water;
  nay, spirit of Wine, and spirit of Wine, one more highly rectify'd then
  the other, and very many other liquors; if (I say) you take any two of
  these liquors, and mixing them in a Glass Viol, against one side of which
  you have fix'd or glued a small round piece of Paper, and shaking them
  well together (so that the parts of them may be somewhat disturb'd and
  move up and down) you endeavour to see that round piece of Paper through
  the body of the liquors, you shall plainly perceive the Figure to wave,
  and to be indented much after the same manner as the limb of the Sun
  through a <i>Telescope</i> seems to be, save onely that the mutations
  here, are much quicker. And if, in steed of this bigger Circle, you take
  a very small spot, and fasten and view it as the former, you will find it
  to appear much like the twinkling of the Starrs, though much quicker:
  which two <i>Phænomena</i>, (for I shall take notice of no more at
  present, though I could instance in multitudes of others) must
  necessarily be caus'd by an <i>inflection</i> of the Rays within the
  terminating superficies of the compounded <i>medium</i>, since the
  surfaces of the transparent body through which the Rays pass to the eye,
  are not at all altered or chang'd.</p>

  <p>This <i>inflection</i> (if I may so call it) I imagine to be nothing
  else, but a <i>multiplicate refraction</i>, caused by the unequal
  <i>density</i> of the constituent parts of the <i>medium</i>, whereby the
  motion, action or progress of the Ray of light is hindred from proceeding
  in a streight line, and <i>inflected</i> or <i>deflected</i> by a
  <i>curve</i>. Now, that it is a <i>curve</i> line is manifest by this
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-37.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 37.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 1.
</span>
  Experiment: I took a Box, such as ADGE, in the first <i>Figure</i> of the
  37. <i>Scheme</i>, whose sides ABCD, and EFGH, were made of two smooth
  flat plates of Glass, then filling it half full with a very strong
  solution of Salt, I filled the other half with very fair fresh water,
  then exposing the opacous side, DHGC, to the Sun, I observ'd both the
  <i>refraction</i> and <i>inflection</i> of the Sun beams, ID &amp; KH,
  and marking as exactly as I could, the points, P, N, O, M, by which the
  Ray, KH, passed through the compounded <i>medium</i>, I found them to be
  in a <i>curve</i> line; for the parts of the <i>medium</i> being
  continually more dense the neerer they were to the bottom, the Ray
  <i>pf</i> was continually more and more deflected downwards from the
  streight line.</p>

  <p>This Inflection may be mechanically explained, either by Monsieur
  <i>Des Cartes</i> principles by conceiving
  the Globuls of the third Element to find less and less resistance against
  that side of them which is downwards, or by a way, which I have further
  explicated in the Inquisition about Colours, to be from an obliquation of
  the pulse of light, whence the under part is continually promoted, and
  consequently refracted towards the perpendicular, which cuts the Orbs at
  right angles. What the particular Figure of the <i>Curve line</i>,
  describ'd by this way of light, is, I shall not now stand to examine,
  especially since there may be so many sorts of it as there may be
  varieties of the Positions of the <i>intermediat</i> degrees of
  <i>density</i> and <i>rarity</i> between the bottom and the top of the
  inflecting Medium.</p>

  <p>I could produce many more Examples and Experiments, to illustrate and
  prove this first Proposition, <i>viz.</i> that there is such a
  constitution of some bodies as will cause inflection. As not to mention
  those I have observ'd in <i>Horn</i>, <i>Tortoise-Shell</i>,
  <i>transparent Gums</i>, and <i>resinous Substances</i>: The <i>veins</i>
  of Glass, nay, of melted <i>Crystal</i>, found, and much complained of by
  Glass-grinders, and others, might sufficiently demonstrate the truth of
  it to any diligent Observator.</p>

  <p>But that, I presume, I have by this Example given proof sufficient
  (<i>viz. ocular demonstration</i>) to evince, that there is such a
  modulation, or bending of the rayes of light, as I have call'd
  <i>inflection</i>, differing both from <i>reflection</i>, and
  <i>refraction</i> (since they are both made in the superficies, this only
  in the middle); and likewise, that this is able or sufficient to produce
  the effects I have ascribed to it.</p>

  <p>It remains therefore to shew, that there is such a property in the
  Air, and that it is sufficient to produce all the above mentioned
  <i>Phænomena</i>, and therefore may be the principal, if not the only
  cause of them.</p>

  <p>First, That there is such a property, may be proved from this, that
  the parts of the Air are some of them more condens'd, others more
  rarified, either by the differing heat, or differing pressure it
  sustains, or by the somewhat heterogeneous vapours interspers'd through
  it. For as the Air is more or less rarified, so does it more or less
  refract a ray of light (that comes out of a denser medium) from the
  perpendicular. This you may find true, if you make tryal of this
  Experiment.</p>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-37.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 37.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 2.
</span>
  <p>Take a small Glass-bubble, made in the form of that in the second
  Figure of the 37. <i>Scheme</i>, and by heating the Glass very hot, and
  thereby very much rarifying the included Air, or, which is better, by
  rarifying a small quantity of water, included in it, into vapours, which
  will expel the most part, if not all the Air, and then sealing up the
  small neck of it, and letting it cool, you may find, if you place it in a
  convenient Instrument, that there will be a manifest difference, as to
  the refraction.</p>

  <p>As if in this second Figure you suppose A to represent a small sight
  or hole, through which the eye looks upon an object, as C, through the
  Glass-bubble B, and the second sight L; all which remain exactly fixt in
  their several places, the object C being so cized and placed, that it may
  just seem to touch the upper and under edge of the hole L: and so all of
  it be seen through the small Glass-ball of rarified Air; then by
  breaking off the small seal'd neck of the
  Bubble (without at all stirring the sights, object, or glass) and
  admitting the external Air, you will find your self unable to see the
  utmost ends of the object; but the terminating rayes AE and AD (which
  were before refracted to G and F by the rarified Air) will proceed almost
  directly to I and H; which alteration of the rayes (seeing there is no
  other alteration made in the Organ by which the Experiment is tryed, save
  only the admission, or exclusion of the condens'd Air) must necessarily
  be caused by the variation of the <i>medium</i> contain'd in the Glass B;
  the greatest difficulty in the making of which Experiment, is from the
  uneven surfaces of the bubble, which will represent an uneven image of
  the object.</p>

  <p>Now, that there is such a difference of the upper and under parts of
  the Air is clear enough evinc'd from the late improvement of the
  <i>Torricellian</i> Experiment, which has been tryed at the tops and feet
  of Mountains; and may be further illustrated, and inquired into, by a
  means, which some whiles since I thought of, and us'd, for the finding by
  what degrees the Air passes from such a degree of Density to such a
  degree of Rarity. And another, for the finding what pressure was
  requisite to make it pass from such a degree of Rarefaction to a
  determinate Density: Which Experiments, because they may be useful to
  illustrate the present Inquiry, I shall briefly describe.</p>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-37.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 37.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 3.
</span>
  <p>I took then a small Glass-pipe AB, about the bigness of a Swans quill, and about
  four foot long, which was very equally drawn, so that, as far as I could
  perceive, no one part was bigger then another: This Tube (being open at
  both ends) I fitted into another small Tube DE, that had a small bore
  just big enough to contain the small Pipe, and this was seal'd up at one,
  and open at the other, end; about which open end I fastned a small wooden
  box C with cement, so that filling the bigger Tube, and part of the box,
  with Quicksilver, I could thrust the smaller Tube into it, till it were
  all covered with the Quicksilver: Having thus done, I fastned my bigger
  Tube against the side of a wall, that it might stand the steadier, and
  plunging the small Tube cleer under the <i>Mercury</i> in the box, I
  stopt the upper end of it very fast with cement, then lifting up the
  small Tube, I drew it up by a small pully, and a string that I had
  fastned to the top of the Room, and found the height of the <i>Mercurial
  Cylinder</i> to be about twenty nine inches.</p>

  <p>Then letting down the Tube again, I opened the top, and then thrust
  down the small Tube, till I perceived the Quicksilver to rise within it
  to a mark that I had plac'd just an inch from the top; and immediately
  clapping on a small piece of cement that I had kept warm, I with a hot
  Iron seal'd up the top very fast, then letting it cool (that both the
  cement might grow hard, and more especially, that the Air might come to
  its temper, natural for the Day I try'd the Experiment in) I observ'd
  diligently, and found the included Air to be exactly an Inch.</p>

  <p>Here you are to take notice, that after the Air is seal'd up, the top
  of the Tube is not to be elevated above the superficies of the
  Quicksilver in the box, till the surface of that within
  the Tube be equal to it, for the Quicksilver (as I have elsewhere prov'd)
  being more heterogeneous to the Glass then the Air, will not naturally
  rise up so high within the small Pipe, as the superficies of the
  <i>Mercury</i> in the box, and therefore you are to observe, how much
  below the outward superficies of the <i>Mercury</i> in the box, that of
  the same in the Tube does stand, when the top being open, free ingress is
  admitted to the outward Air.</p>

  <p>Having thus done, I permitted the <i>Cylinder</i>, or small Pipe, to
  rise out of the box, till I found the surface of the Quicksilver in the
  Pipe to be two inches above that in the box, and found the Air to have
  expanded it self but one sixteenth part of an inch; then drawing up the
  small pipe, till I found the height of the Quicksilver within to be four
  inches above that without, I observed the Air to be expanded only 1/7 of
  an inch more then it was at first, and to take up the room of 1-1/7 inch:
  then I raised the Tube till the Cylinder was six inches high, and found
  the Air to take up 1-2/9 inches of room in the Pipe; then to 8, 10, 12.
  <i>&amp;c.</i> the expansion of the Air that I found to each of which
  Cylinders are set down in the following Table; where the first row
  signifies the height of the <i>Mercurial Cylinder</i>; the next, the
  expansion of the Air; the third, the pressure of the <i>Atmosphere</i>,
  or the highest <i>Cylinder</i> of <i>Mercury</i>, which was then neer
  thirty inches: The last signifies the force of the Air so expanded, which
  is found by substracting the first row of numbers out of the third; for
  having found, that the outward Air would then keep up the Quicksilver to
  thirty inches, look whatever of that height is wanting must be attributed
  to the Elater of the Air depressing. And therefore having the Expansion
  in the second row, and the height of the subjacent <i>Cylinder</i> of
  <i>Mercury</i> in the first, and the greatest height of the
  <i>Cylinder</i> of <i>Mercury</i>, which of it self counterballances the
  whole pressure of the <i>Atmosphere</i>; by substracting the numbers of
  the first row out of the numbers of the third, you will have the measure
  of the <i>Cylinders</i> so deprest, and consequently the force of the
  Air, in the several Expansions, registred.</p>

  <p>I had several other Tables of my Observations, and Calculations, which
  I then made; but it being above a twelve month since I made them; and by
  that means having forgot many circumstances and particulars, I was
  resolved to make them over once again, which I did <i>August</i> the
  second 1661. with the very same Tube which I used the year before, when I
  first made the Experiment (for it being a very good one, I had carefully
  preserv'd it:) And after having tryed it over and over again; and being
  not well satisfied of some particulars, I, at last, having put all things
  in very good order, and being as attentive, and observant, as possibly I
  could, of every circumstance requisite to be taken notice of, did
  register my several Observations in this following Table. In the making
  of which, I did not exactly follow the method that I had used at first;
  but, having lately heard of Mr. <i>Townly</i>'s <i>Hypothesis</i>, I
  shap'd my course in such sort, as would be most convenient for the
  examination of that <i>Hypothesis</i>; the event of which you have in the
  latter part of the last Table.</p>

  <p>The other Experiment was, to find what degrees of force were requisite
  to compress, or condense, the Air into such or such a bulk.</p>

  <p>The manner of proceeding therein was this: I took a Tube about five
  foot long, one of whose ends was sealed up, and bended in the form of a
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-37.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 37.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 4.
</span>
  <i>Syphon</i>, much like that represented in the fourth Figure of the 37.
  <i>Scheme</i>, one side whereof AD, that was open at A, was about fifty
  inches long, the other side BC, shut at B, was not much above seven
  inches long, then placing it exactly perpendicular, I pour'd in a little
  Quicksilver, and found that the Air BC was 6-7/8 inches, or very near to
  seven; then pouring in Quicksilver at the longer Tube, I continued
  filling of it till the Air in the shorter part of it was contracted into
  half the former dimensions, and found the height exactly nine and twenty
  inches; and by making several other tryals, in several other degrees of
  condensation of the Air, I found them exactly answer the former
  <i>Hypothesis</i>.</p>

  <p>But having (by reason it was a good while since I first made)
  forgotten many particulars, and being much unsatisfied in others, I made
  the Experiment over again, and, from the several tryals, collected the
  former part of the following Table: Where in the row next the left hand
  24. signifies the dimensions of the Air, sustaining only the pressure of
  the <i>Atmosphere</i>, which at that time was equal to a <i>Cylinder</i>
  of <i>Mercury</i> of nine and twenty inches: The next Figure above it
  (20) was the dimensions of the Air induring the first compression, made
  by a <i>Cylinder</i> of <i>Mercury</i> 5-3/16 high, to which the pressure
  of the <i>Atmosphere</i> nine and twenty inches being added, the elastick
  strength of the Air so comprest will be found 34-3/16, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>From which Experiments, I think, we may safely conclude, that the
  Elater of the Air is reciprocal to its extension, or at least very neer.
  So that to apply it to our present purpose (which was indeed the chief
  cause of inventing these wayes of tryal) we will suppose a
  <i>Cylinder</i> indefinitely extended upwards, [I say a <i>Cylinder</i>,
  not a piece of a <i>Cone</i>, because, as I may elsewhere shew in the
  Explication of Gravity, that <i>triplicate</i> proportion of the shels of
  a Sphere, to their respective diameters, I suppose to be removed in this
  case by the decrease of the power of Gravity] and the pressure of the Air
  at the bottom of this <i>Cylinder</i> to be strong enough to keep up a
  <i>Cylinder</i> of <i>Mercury</i> of thirty inches: Now because by the
  most accurate tryals of the most illustrious and incomparable Mr.
  <i>Boyle</i>, published in his deservedly famous Pneumatick Book, the
  weight of Quicksilver, to that of the Air here below, is found neer about
  as fourteen thousand to one: If we suppose the parts of the
  <i>Cylinder</i> of the <i>Atmosphere</i> to be every where of an equal
  density, we shall (as he there deduces) find it extended to the height of
  thirty five thousand feet, or seven miles: But because by these
  Experiments we have somewhat confirm'd the hypothesis of the reciprocal
  proportion of the Elaters to the Extensions we shall find, that by
  supposing this <i>Cylinder</i> of the <i>Atmosphere</i> divided into a
  thousand parts, each of which being equivalent to thirty five feet, or
  seven geometrical paces, that is, each of these divisions containing as
  much Air as is suppos'd in a <i>Cylinder</i> neer the earth of equal
  diameter, and thirty five foot high, we shall find the lowermost to press
  against the surface of the Earth with the whole weight of the above
  mentioned thousand parts; the pressure of the bottom of the second
  against the top of the first to be 1000 - 1 = 999. of the third against
  the second to be 1000 - 2 = 998. of the fourth against the third to be
  1000 - 3 = 997. of the uppermost against the 999. or that next below it,
  to be 1000 - 999 = 1. so that the extension of the lowermost next the
  Earth, will be to the extension of the next below the uppermost, as 1. to
  999. for as the pressure sustained by the 999. is to the pressure
  sustain'd by the first, so is the extension of the first to the extension
  of the 999. so that, from this hypothetical calculation, we shall find
  the Air to be indefinitely extended: For if we suppose the whole
  thickness of the Air to be divided, as I just now instanced, into a
  thousand parts, and each of those under differing Dimensions, or
  Altitudes, to contain an equall quantity of Air, we shall find, that the
  first <i>Cylinder</i>, whose Base is supposed to lean on the Earth, will
  be found to be extended 35-35/999 foot; the second equal Division, or
  <i>Cylinder</i>, whose <i>basis</i> is supposed to lean on the top of the
  first, shall have its top extended higher by 35-70/998 the third
  35-105/997 the fourth 35-140/996 and so onward, each equal quantity of
  Air having its dimensions measured by 35. and some additional number
  exprest alwayes in the manner of a fraction, whose numerator is alway the
  number of the place multipli'd by 35. and whose denominator is alwayes
  the pressure of the <i>Atmosphere</i> sustain'd by that part, so that by
  this means we may easily calculate the height of 999. divisions of those
  1000. divisions, I suppos'd; whereas the uppermost may
  extend it self more then as high again, nay, perhaps indefinitely, or
  beyond the Moon; for the Elaters and Expansions being in reciprocal
  proportions, since we cannot yet find the <i>plus ultra</i>, beyond which
  the Air will not expand it self, we cannot determine the height of the
  Air: for since, as we have shewn, the proportion will be alway as the
  pressure sustain'd by any part is to 35. so 1000. to the expansion of
  that part; the multiplication or product therefore of the pressure, and
  expansion, that is, of the two extream proportionals, being alwayes equal
  to the product of the means, or 35000. it follows, since that Rectangle
  or Product may be made up of the multiplication of infinite diversities
  of numbers, that the height of the Air is also indefinite; for since (as
  far as I have yet been able to try) the Air seems capable of an
  indefinite Expansion, the pressure may be decreased in <i>infinitum</i>,
  and consequently its expansion upwards indefinite also.</p>

  <p>There being therefore such a difference of density, and no Experiment
  yet known to prove a <i>Saltus</i>, or skipping from one degree of rarity
  to another much differing from it, that is, that an upper part of the Air
  should so much differ from that immediately <i>subjacent</i> to it, as to
  make a distinct superficies, such as we observe between the Air and
  Water, <i>&amp;c.</i> But it being more likely, that there is a continual
  increase of rarity in the parts of the Air, the further they are removed
  from the surface of the Earth: It will hence necessarily follow, that (as
  in the Experiment of the salt and fresh Water) the ray of Light passing
  obliquely through the Air also, which is of very different density, will
  be continually, and infinitely inflected, or bended, from a streight, or
  direct motion.</p>

  <p>This granted, the reason of all the above recited <i>Phænomena</i>,
  concerning the appearance of the Celestial Bodies, will very easily be
  deduced. As,</p>

  <p>First, The redness of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, will be found to be
  caused by the inflection of the rays within the <i>Atmosphere</i>. That
  it is not really in or near the luminous bodies, will, I suppose, be very
  easily granted, seeing that this redness is observable in several places
  differing in Longitude, to be at the same time different, the setting and
  rising Sun of all parts being for the most part red:</p>

  <p>And secondly, That it is not meerly the colour of the Air interpos'd,
  will, I suppose, without much more difficulty be yielded, seeing that we
  may observe a very great <i>interstitium</i> of Air betwixt the Object,
  and the Eye, makes it appear of a dead blew, far enough differing from a
  red, or yellow.</p>

  <p>But thirdly, That it proceeds from the refraction, or inflection, of
  the rays by the <i>Atmosphere</i>, this following Experiment will, I
  suppose, sufficiently manifest.</p>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-37.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 37.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 5.
</span>
  <p>Take a sphærical Crystalline Viol, such as is describ'd in the fifth
  Figure ABCD, and, having fill'd it with pure clear Water, expose it to
  the Sun beams; then taking a piece of very fine <i>Venice</i> Paper,
  apply it against that side of the Globe that is opposite to the Sun, as
  against the side BC, and you shall perceive a bright
  red Ring to appear, caus'd by the refraction of the Rays, AAAA, which is
  made by the Globe; in which Experiment, if the Glass and Water be very
  cleer, so that there be no Sands nor bubbles in the Glass, nor dirt in
  the Water, you shall not perceive any appearance of any other colour. To
  apply which Experiment, we may imagine the <i>Atmosphere</i> to be a
  great transparent Globe, which being of a substance more dense then the
  other, or (which comes to the same) that has its parts more dense towards
  the middle, the Sun beams that are tangents, or next within the tangents
  of this Globe, will be refracted or inflected from their direct passage
  towards the center of the Globe, whence, according to the laws of
  refractions made in a triangular <i>Prism</i>, and the generation of
  colour set down in the description of Muscovi-glass there must
  necessarily appear a red colour in the <i>transitus</i> or passage of
  those tangent Rays. To make this more plain, we will suppose (in the
  sixth <i>Figure</i>) ABCD, to represent the Globe of the
  <i>Atmosphere</i>, EFGH to represent the opacous Globe of the Earth,
  lying in the midst of it, neer to which, the parts of the Air, sustaining
  a very great pressure, are thereby very much condens'd, from whence those
  Rays that are by inflection made tangents to the Globe of the Earth, and
  those without them, that pass through the more condens'd part of the
  <i>Atmosphere</i>, as suppose between A and E, are by reason of the
  inequality of the <i>medium</i>, inflected towards the center, whereby
  there must necessarily be generated a red colour, as is more plainly
  shewn in the former cited place; hence whatsoever opacous bodies (as
  vapours, or the like) shall chance to be elevated into those parts, will
  reflect a red towards the eye; and therefore those evenings and mornings
  appear reddest, that have the most store of vapours and halituous
  substances exhaled to a convenient distance from the Earth; for thereby
  the inflection is made the greater, and thereby the colour also the more
  intense; and several of those exhalations being opacous, reflect several
  of those Rays, which, through an <i>Homogeneous</i> transparent
  <i>medium</i> would pass unseen; and therefore we see, that when there
  chances to be any clouds situated in those Regions they reflect a strong
  and vivid red. Now, though one great cause of the redness may be this
  inflection, yet I cannot wholly exclude the colour of the vapours
  themselves, which may have something of redness in them, they being
  partly nitrous; and partly fuliginous; both which steams tinge the Rays
  that pass through them, as is made evident by looking at bodies through
  the fumes of <i>Aqua fortis</i> or spirit of <i>Nitre</i> [as the newly
  mentioned Illustrious Person has demonstrated] and also through the smoak
  of a Fire or Chimney.</p>

  <p>Having therefore made it probable at least, that the morning and
  evening redness may partly proceed from this inflection or refraction of
  the Rays, we shall next shew how the Oval Figure will be likewise easily
  deduced.</p>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-37.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 37.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 6.
</span>
  <p>Suppose we therefore, EFGH in the sixth <i>Figure</i> of the 37.
  <i>Scheme</i>, to represent the Earth; ABCD, the <i>Atmosphere</i>; EI,
  and EL, two Rays coming from the Sun, the one from the upper, the other
  from the neather Limb, these Rays, being by the
  <i>Atmosphere</i> inflected, appear to the eye at E, as if they had come
  from the points, N and O; and because the Ray L has a greater inclination
  upon the inequality of the <i>Atmosphere</i> then I, therefore must it
  suffer a greater inflection, and consequently be further elevated above
  its true place, then the Ray I, which has a less inclination, will be
  elevated above its true place; whence it will follow, that the lower side
  appearing neerer the upper then really it is, and the two <i>lateral</i>
  sides, <i>viz.</i> the right and left side, suffering no sensible
  alteration from the inflection, at least what it does suffer, does rather
  increase the visible Diameter then diminish it, as I shall shew by and
  by, the Figure of the luminous body must necessarily appear somewhat
  <i>Elliptical</i>.</p>

<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-37.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 37.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 7.
</span>
  <p>This will be more plain, if in the seventh <i>Figure</i> of the 37.
  <i>Scheme</i> we suppose AB to represent the sensible Horizon; CDEF, the
  body of the Sun really below it; GHIK, the same appearing above it,
  elevated by the inflection of the <i>Atmosphere</i>: For if, according to
  the best observation, we make the visible Diameter of the Sun to be about
  three or four and thirty minutes, and the Horizontal refraction according
  to <i>Ticho</i> be thereabout, or somewhat more, the lower limb of the
  Sun E, will be elevated to I; but because, by his account, the point C
  will be elevated but 29. minutes, as having not so great an inclination
  upon the inequality of the Air, therefore IG, which will be the apparent
  refracted perpendicular Diameter of the Sun, will be less then CG, which
  is but 29. minutes, and consequently six or seven minutes shorter then
  the unrefracted apparent Diameter. The parts, D and F, will be likewise
  elevated to H and K, whose refraction, by reason of its inclination, will
  be bigger then that of the point C, though less then that of E; therefore
  will the semidiameter IL, be shorter then LG, and consequently the under
  side of the appearing Sun more flat then the upper.</p>

  <p>Now, because the Rays from the right and left sides of the Sun,
  <i>&amp;c.</i> have been observ'd by <i>Ricciolo</i> and
  <i>Grimaldus</i>, to appear more distant one from another then really
  they are, though (by very many Observations that I have made for that
  purpose, with a very good <i>Telescope</i>, fitted with a divided Ruler)
  I could never perceive any great alteration, yet there being really some,
  it will not be amiss, to shew that this also proceeds from the refraction
  or inflection of the <i>Atmosphere</i>; and this will be manifest, if we
  consider the <i>Atmosphere</i> as a transparent Globe, or at least a
  transparent shell, encompassing an opacous Globe, which, being more dense
  then the <i>medium</i> encompassing it, refracts or inflects all the
  entring parallel Rays into a point or focus, so that wheresoever the
  Observator is plac'd within the <i>Atmosphere</i>, between the focus and
  the luminous body, the <i>lateral</i> Rays must necessarily be more
  converg'd towards his eye by the refraction or inflection, then they
  would have been without it; and therefore the Horizontal Diameter of the
  luminous body must necessarily be augmented.</p>

  <p>This might be more plainly manifest to the eye by the sixth
  <i>Figure</i>; but because it would be somwhat tedious, and the thing
  being obvious enough to be imagin'd by any one that
  attentively considers it, I shall rather omit it, and proceed to shew,
  that the mass of Air neer the surface of the Earth, consists, or is made
  up, of parcels, which do very much differ from one another in point of
  density and rarity; and consequently the Rays of light that pass through
  them will be variously inflected, here one way, and there another,
  according as they pass so or so through those differing parts; and those
  parts being always in motion, either upwards or downwards, or to the
  right or left, or in some way compounded of these, they do by this their
  motion inflect the Rays, now this way, and presently that way.</p>

  <p>This irregular, unequal and unconstant inflection of the Rays of
  light, is the reason why the limb of the <i>Sun</i>, <i>Moon</i>,
  <i>Jupiter</i>, <i>Saturn</i>, <i>Mars</i>, and <i>Venus</i>, appear to
  wave or dance; and why the body of the Starrs appear to tremulate or
  twinkle, their bodies, by this means, being sometimes magnify'd, and
  sometimes diminished; sometimes elevated, otherwhiles depress'd; now
  thrown to the right hand, and then to the left.</p>

  <p>And that there is such a property or unequal distribution of parts, is
  manifest from the various degrees of heat and cold that are found in the
  Air; from whence will follow a differing density and rarity, both as to
  quantity and refraction; and likewise from the vapours that are
  interpos'd, (which, by the way, I imagine, as to refraction or
  inflection, to do the same thing, as if they were rarify'd Air; and that
  those vapours that ascend, are both lighter, and less dense, then the
  ambient Air which boys them up; and that those which descend, are heavier
  and more dense) The first of these may be found true, if you take a good
  thick piece of Glass, and heating it pretty hot in the fire, lay it upon
  such another piece of Glass, or hang it in the open Air by a piece of
  Wire, then looking upon some far distant Object (such as a Steeple or
  Tree) so as the Rays from that Object pass directly over the Glass before
  they enter your eye, you shall find such a tremulation and wavering of
  the remote Object, as will very much offend your eye: The like tremulous
  motion you may observe to be caus'd by the ascending steams of Water, and
  the like. Now, from the first of these it is manifest, that from the
  rarifaction of the parts of the Air, by heat, there is caus'd a differing
  refraction, and from the ascension of the more rarify'd parts of the Air,
  which are thrust up by the colder, and therefore more condens'd and
  heavie, is caus'd an undulation or wavering of the Object; for I think,
  that there are very few will grant, that Glass, by as gentle a heat as
  may be endur'd by ones hand, should send forth any of its parts in steams
  or vapours, which does not seem to be much wasted by that violent fire of
  the green Glass-house; but, if yet it be doubted, let Experiment be
  further made with that body that is accounted, by Chymists and others,
  the most ponderous and fix'd in the world; for by heating of a piece of
  Gold, and proceeding in the same manner, you may find the same
  effects.</p>

  <p>This trembling and shaking of the Rays, is more sensibly caus'd by an
  actual flame, or quick fire, or anything else heated glowing hot; as by a
  Candle, live Coal, red-hot Iron, or a piece of Silver, and the like: the
  same also appears very conspicuous, if you look at an Object betwixt
  which and your eye, the rising smoak of
  some Chimney is interpos'd; which brings into my mind what I had once the
  opportunity to observe, which was, the Sun rising to my eye just over a
  Chimney that sent forth a copious steam of smoak; and taking a short
  <i>Telescope</i>, which I had then by me, I observ'd the body of the Sun,
  though it was but just peep'd above the Horizon, to have its underside,
  not onely flatted, and press'd inward, as it usually is when neer the
  Earth; but to appear more protuberant downwards then if it had suffered
  no refraction at all; and besides all this, the whole body of the Sun
  appear'd to tremble or dance, and the edges or limb to be very ragged or
  indented, undulating or waving, much in the manner of a flag in the
  Wind.</p>

  <p>This I have likewise often observ'd in a hot Sunshiny Summer's day,
  that looking on an Object over a hot stone, or dry hot earth, I have
  found the Object to be undulated or shaken, much after the same manner.
  And if you look upon any remote Object through a <i>Telescope</i> (in a
  hot Summer's day especially) you shall find it likewise to appear
  tremulous. And further, if there chance to blow any wind, or that the air
  between you and the Object be in a motion or current, whereby the parts
  of it, both rarify'd and condens'd, are swiftly remov'd towards the right
  or left, if then you observe the Horizontal ridge of a Hill far distant,
  through a very good <i>Telescope</i>, you shall find it to wave much like
  the Sea, and those waves will appear to pass the same way with the
  wind.</p>

  <p>From which, and many other Experiments, 'tis cleer that the lower
  Region of the Air, especially that part of it which lieth neerest to the
  Earth, has, for the most part, its constituent parcels variously
  agitated, either by heat or winds, by the first of which, some of them
  are made more rare, and so suffer a less refraction; others are
  interwoven, either with ascending or descending vapours; the former of
  which being more light, and so more rarify'd, have likewise a less
  refraction; the latter being more heavie, and consequently more dense,
  have a greater.</p>

  <p>Now, because that heat and cold are equally diffus'd every way; and
  that the further it is spread, the weaker it grows; hence it will follow,
  that the most part of the under Region of the Air will be made up of
  several kinds of <i>lentes</i>, some whereof will have the properties of
  <i>Convex</i>, others of <i>Concave</i> <i>glasses</i>, which, that I may
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-37.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 37.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 8.
</span>
  the more intelligibly make out, we will suppose in the eighth
  <i>Figure</i> of the 37. <i>Scheme</i>, that A represents an ascending
  vapour, which, by reason of its being somewhat <i>Heterogeneous</i> to
  the ambient Air, is thereby thrust into a kind of Globular form, not any
  where terminated, but gradually finished, that is, it is most rarify'd in
  the middle about A. somewhat more condens'd about BB, more then that
  about CC; yet further, about DD, almost of the same density with the
  ambient Air about EE;, and lastly, inclosed with the more dense Air FF,
  so that from A, to FF, there is a continual increase of density. The
  reason of which will be manifest, if we consider the rising vapour to be
  much warmer then the ambient heavie Air; for by the coldness of the
  ambient Air, the shell EE will be more refrigerated then DD, and that
  then CC, which will be yet more then BB, and that more then
  A; so that from F to A, there is a continual increase of heat, and
  consequently of rarity; from whence it will necessarily follow, that the
  Rays of light will be inflected or refracted in it, in the same manner as
  they would be in a <i>Concave-glase</i>; for the Rays <i>GKI</i>,
  <i>GKI</i> will be inflected by <i>GKH</i>, <i>GKH</i>, which will easily
  follow from what I before explained concerning the inflection of the
  <i>Atmosphere</i>.</p>

  <p>On the other side, a descending vapour, or any part of the air
  included by an ascending vapour, will exhibit the same effects with a
  <i>Convex lens</i>; for, if we suppose, in the former Figure, the quite
  contrary constitution to that last describ'd; that is, the ambient Air FF
  being hotter then any part of that matter within any circle, therefore
  the coldest part must necessarily be A, as being farthest remov'd from
  the heat, all the intermediate spaces will be gradually discriminated by
  the continuall mixture of heat and cold, so that it will be hotter at EE,
  then DD, in DD then CC, in CC then BB, and in BB then A. From which, a
  like refraction and condensation will follow, and consequently a lesser
  or greater refraction, so that every included part will refract more then
  the including, by which means the Rays, GKI, GKI, coming from a Starr, or
  some remote Object, are so inflected, that they will again concurr and
  meet, in the point M. By the interposition therefore of this desending
  vapour the visible body of the Star, or other Object, is very much
  augmented, as by the former it was diminished.</p>

  <p>From the quick consecutions of these two, one after another, between
  the Object and your eye, caused by their motion upwards or downwards,
  proceeding from their levity or gravity, or to the right or left,
  proceeding from the wind, a Starr may appear, now bigger, now less, then
  really it would otherwise without them; and this is that property of a
  Starr, which is commonly call'd twinkling, or scintillation.</p>

  <p>The reason why a Star will now appear of one colour, now of another,
  which for the most part happens when 'tis neer the Horizon, may very
  easily be deduc'd from its appearing now in the middle of the vapour,
  other whiles neer the edge; for if you look against the body of a Starr
  with a <i>Telescope</i> that has a pretty deep <i>Convex</i> Eye-glass,
  and so order it, that the Star may appear sometimes in one place, and
  sometimes in another of it; you may perceive this or that particular
  colour to be predominant in the apparent Figure of the Starr, according
  as it is more or less remote from the middle of the <i>Lens</i>. This I
  had here further explain'd, but that it does more properly belong to
  another place.</p>

  <p>I shall therefore onely add some few Queries, which the consideration
  of these particulars hinted, and so finish this Section.</p>

  <p>And the first I shall propound is, Whether there may not be made an
  artificial transparent body of an exact Globular Figure that shall so
  inflect or refract all the Rays, that, coming from one point, fall upon
  any <i>Hemisphere</i> of it; that every one of them may meet on the
  opposite side, and cross one another exactly in a point; and that it may
  do the like also with all the Rays that, coming from a <i>lateral</i>
  point, fall upon any other <i>Hemisphere</i>; for if so, there were to be
  hoped a perfection of <i>Dioptricks</i>, and a
  transmigration into heaven, even whil'st we remain here upon earth in the
  flesh, and a descending or penetrating into the center and innermost
  recesses of the earth, and all earthly bodies; nay, it would open not
  onely a cranney, but a large window (as I may so speak) into the Shop of
  Nature, whereby we might be enabled to see both the tools and operators,
  and the very manner of the operation it self of Nature; this, could it be
  effected, would as farr surpass all other kind of perspectives as the
  vast extent of Heaven does the small point of the Earth, which distance
  it would immediately remove, and unite them, as 'twere, into one, at
  least, that there should appear no more distance between them then the
  length of the Tube, into the ends of which these Glasses should be
  inserted: Now, whether this may not be effected with parcels of Glass of
  several densities, I have sometimes proceeded so farr as to doubt (though
  in truth, as to the general, I have wholly despair'd of it) for I have
  often observ'd in Optical Glasses a very great variety of the parts,
  which are commonly called Veins; nay, some of them round enough (for they
  are for the most part, drawn out into firings) to constitute a kind of
  <i>lens</i>.</p>

  <p>This I should further proceed to hope, had any one been so inquisitive
  as to have found out the way of making any transparent body, either more
  dense or more rare, for then it might be possible to compose a Globule
  that should be more dense in the middle of it, then in any other part,
  and to compose the whole bulk, so as that there should be a continual
  gradual transition from one degree of density to another; such as should
  be found requisite for the desired inflection of the
  <i>transmigrating</i> Rays; but of this enough at present, because I may
  say more of it when I set down my own Trials concerning the melioration
  of <i>Dioptricks</i>, where I shall enumerate with how many several
  substances I have made both <i>Microscopes</i>, and <i>Telescopes</i>,
  and by what and how many, ways: Let such as have leisure and opportunity
  farther consider it.</p>

  <p>The next Quæry shall be, whether by the same collection of a more
  dense body then the other, or at least, of the denser part of the other,
  there might not be imagin'd a reason of the apparition of some new fix'd
  Stars, as those in the Swan, <i>Cassiope's Charr</i>,
  <i>Serpentarius</i>, <i>Piscis</i>, <i>Cetus</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, Whether it be possible to define the height of the
  <i>Atmosphere</i> from this inflection of the Rays, or from the
  Quicksilver Experiment of the rarifaction or extension of the Air.</p>

  <p>Fourthly, Whether the disparity between the upper and under Air be not
  sometimes so great, as to make a reflecting superficies; I have had
  several Observations which seem to have proceeded from some such cause,
  but it would be too long to relate and examine them. An Experiment, also
  somewhat analogous to this, I have made with Salt-water and Fresh, which
  two liquors, in most Positions, seem'd the same, and not to be separated
  by any determinate superficies, which separating surface yet in some
  other Positions did plainly appear.</p>

  <p>And if so, Whether the reason of the equal bounding or <i>terminus</i>
  of the under parts of the clouds may not proceed from this cause;
  whether, secondly, the Reason of the apparition of
  many Suns may not be found out, by considering how the Rays of the Sun
  may so be reflected, as to describe a pretty true Image of the body, as
  we find them from any regular Superficies. Whether also this may not be
  found to cause the apparition of some of those <i>Parelii</i>, of
  counterfeit Suns, which appear coloured, by refracting the Rays so, as to
  make the body of the Sun appear in quite another place then really it is.
  But of this more elsewhere.</p>

  <p>5. Whether the <i>Phænomena</i> of the Clouds may not be made out by
  this diversity of density in the upper and under parts of the Air, by
  supposing the Air above them to be much lighter then they themselves are,
  and they themselves to be yet lighter then that which is subjacent to
  them, many of them seeming to be the same substance with the Cobwebs that
  fly in the Air after a Fog.</p>

  <p>Now that such a constitution of the Air and Clouds, if such there be,
  may be sufficient to perform this effect, may be confirm'd by this
  Experiment.</p>

  <p>Make as strong a Solution of Salt as you are able, then filling a
  Glass of some depth half full with it, fill the other half with fresh
  Water, and poyse a little Glass-bubble, so as that it may sink pretty
  quick in fresh Water, which take and put into the aforesaid Glass, and
  you shall find it to sink till it comes towards the middle, where it will
  remain fixt, without moving either upwards or downwards. And by a second
  Experiment, of poising such a bubble in water, whose upper part is
  warmer, and consequently lighter, then the under, which is colder and
  heavier; the manner of which follows in this next Quæry, which is,</p>

  <p>6. Whether the rarifaction and condensation of Water be not made after
  the same manner, as those effects are produc'd in the Air by heat; for I
  once pois'd a seal'd up Glass-bubble so exactly, that never so small an
  addition would make it sink, and as small a detraction make it swim,
  which suffering to rest in that Vessel of Water for some time, I alwayes
  found it about noon to be at the bottom of the Water, and at night, and
  in the morning, at the top: Imagining this to proceed from the
  Rarifaction of the Water, caus'd by the heat, I made tryal, and found
  most true; for I was able at any time, either to depress, or raise it, by
  heat and cold; for if I let the Pipe stand for some time in cold water, I
  could easily raise the Bubble from the bottom, whither I had a little
  afore detruded it, by putting the same Pipe into warm Water. And this way
  I have been able, for a very considerable time, to keep a Bubble so
  poys'd in the Water, as that it should remain in the middle, and neither
  sink, nor swim: For gently heating the upper part of the Pipe with a
  Candle, Coal, or hot Iron, till I perceived the Bubble begin to descend,
  then forbearing, I have observed it to descend to such or such a station,
  and there to remain suspended for some hours, till the heat by degrees
  were quite vanished, when it would again ascend to its former place. This
  I have also often observed naturally performed by the heat of the Air,
  which being able to rarifie the upper parts of the Water sooner then the
  lower, by reason of its immediate contact, the heat of the Air
  has sometimes so slowly increased, that I
  have observed the Bubble to be some hours in passing between the top and
  bottom.</p>

  <p>7. Whether the appearance of the <i>Pike</i> of <i>Tenerif</i>, and
  several other high Mountains, at so much greater a distance then seems to
  agree with their respective heights, be not to be attributed to the
  <i>Curvature</i> of the visual Ray, that is made by its passing obliquely
  through so differingly <i>Dense</i> a Medium from the top to the eye very
  far distant in the Horizon: For since we have already, I hope, made it
  very probable, that there is such an <i>inflection</i> of the Rays by the
  differing density of the parts of the Air; and since I have found, by
  several Experiments made on places comparatively not very high, and have
  yet found the pressure sustain'd by those parts of the Air at the top and
  bottom, and also their differing Expansions very considerable: Insomuch
  that I have found the pressure of the <i>Atmosphere</i> lighter at the
  top of St. <i>Paul</i>'s Steeple in <i>London</i> (which is about two
  hundred foot high) then at the bottom by a sixtieth or fiftieth part, and
  the expansion at the top greater then that at the bottom by neer about so
  much also; for the <i>Mercurial Cylinder</i> at the bottom was about 39.
  inches, and at the top half an inch lower; the Air also included in the
  Weather-glass, that at the bottom fill'd only 155. spaces, at the top
  fill'd 158. though the heat at the top and bottom was found exactly the
  same with a scal'd <i>Thermometer</i>: I think it very rational to
  suppose, that the greatest Curvature of the Rays is made nearest the
  Earth, and that the inflection of the Rays, above 3. or 4. miles upwards,
  is very inconsiderable, and therefore that by this means such
  calculations of the height of Mountains, as are made from the distance
  they are visible in the Horizon, from the supposal that that Ray is a
  straight Line (that from the top of the Mountain is, as 'twere, a Tangent
  to the Horizon whence it is seen) which really is a <i>Curve</i>, is very
  erroneous. Whence, I suppose, proceeds the reason of the exceedingly
  differing Opinions and Assertions of several Authors, about the height of
  several very high Hills.</p>

  <p>8. Whether this Inflection of the Air will not very much alter the
  supposed distances of the Planets, which seem to have a very great
  dependence upon the Hypothetical refraction or inflection of the Air, and
  that refraction upon the hypothetical height and density of the Air: For
  since (as I hope) I have here shewn the Air to be quite otherwise then
  has been hitherto suppos'd, by manifesting it to be, both of a vast, at
  least an uncertain, height, and of an unconstant and irregular density;
  It must necessarily follow, that its inflection must be varied
  accordingly: And therefore we may hence learn, upon what sure grounds all
  the Astronomers hitherto have built, who have calculated the distance of
  the Planets from their Horizontal <i>Parallax</i>; for since the
  Refraction and <i>Parallax</i> are so nearly ally'd, that the one cannot
  be known without the other, especially by any wayes that have been yet
  attempted, how uncertain must the <i>Parallax</i> be, when the Refraction
  is unknown? And how easie is it for Astronomers to assign what distance
  they please to the Planets, and defend them, when they have such a
  curious <i>subterfuge</i> as that of Refraction, wherein a very little
  variation will allow them liberty enough to place the Celestial Bodies at
  what distance they please.</p>

  <p>If therefore we would come to any certainty in this point, we must go
  other wayes to work; and as I have here examined the height and
  refractive property of the Air by other wayes then are usual, so must we
  find the Parallax of the Planets by wayes not yet practiced; and to this
  end, I cannot imagine any better way, then the Observations of them by
  two persons at very far distant parts of the Earth, that lye as neer as
  may be under the same Meridian, or Degree of longitude, but differing as
  much in latitude, as there can be places conveniently found: These two
  persons, at certain appointed times, should (as near as could be) both at
  the same time, observe the way of the <i>Moon</i>, <i>Mars</i>,
  <i>Venus</i>, <i>Jupiter</i>, and <i>Saturn</i>, amongst the fixt Stars,
  with a good large <i>Telescope</i>, and making little Iconismes, or
  pictures, of the small fixed Stars, that appear to each of them to lye in
  or near the way of the Center of the Planet, and the exact measure of the
  apparent Diameter; from the comparing of such Observations together, we
  might certainly know the true distance, or Parallax, of the Planet. And
  having any one true Parallax of these Planets, we might very easily have
  the other by their apparent Diameters, which the <i>Telescope</i>
  likewise affords us very accurately. And thence their motions might be
  much better known, and their Theories more exactly regulated. And for
  this purpose I know not any one place more convenient for such an
  Observation to be made in, then in the Island of St. <i>Helena</i>, upon
  the Coast of <i>Africk</i>, which lyes about sixteen degrees to the
  Southwards of the Line, and is very near, according to the latest
  Geographical Maps, in the same Meridian with <i>London</i>; for though
  they may not perhaps lye exactly in the same, yet their Observations,
  being ordered according to what I shall anon shew, it will not be
  difficult to find the true distance of the Planet. But were they both
  under the same Meridian, it would be much better.</p>

  <p>And because Observations may be much easier, and more accurately made
  with good <i>Telescopes</i>, then with any other Instruments, it will
  not, I suppose, seem impertinent to explain a little what wayes I judge
  most fit and convenient for that particular. Such therefore as shall be
  the Observators for this purpose, should be furnished with the best
  <i>Telescopes</i> that can be had, the longer the better and more exact
  will their Observations be, though they are somewhat the more difficultly
  manag'd. These should be fitted with a <i>Rete</i>, or divided Scale,
  plac'd at such a distance within the Eye-glass, that they may be
  distinctly seen, which should be the measures of minutes and seconds; by
  this Instrument each Observator should, at certain prefixt times, observe
  the Moon, or other Planet, in, or very near, the Meridian; and because it
  may be very difficult to find two convenient stations that will happen to
  be just under the same Meridian, they shall, each of them, observe the
  way of the Planet, both for an hour before, and an hour after, it arrive
  at the Meridian; and by a line, or stroke, amongst the small fixed Stars,
  they shall denote out the way that each of them observ'd the Center of
  the Planet to be mov'd in for those two hours: These Observations each of
  them shall repeat for many dayes together, that both it may happen, that
  both of them may sometimes make their Observations
  together, and that from divers Experiments we may be the better assured
  of what certainty and exactness such kind of Observations are like to
  prove. And because many of the Stars which may happen to come within the
  compass of such an <i>Iconism</i>, or Map, may be such as are only
  visible through a good <i>Telescope</i>, whose Positions perhaps have not
  been noted, nor their longitudes, or latitudes, any where remarked;
  therefore each Observator should indeavour to insert some fixt Star,
  whose longitude, and latitude, is known; or with his <i>Telescope</i> he
  shall find the Position of some notable <i>telescopical</i> Star,
  inserted in his Map, to some known fixt Star, whose place in the
  <i>Zodiack</i> is well defin'd.</p>

  <p>Having by this means found the true distance of the Moon, and having
  observed well the <i>apparent Diameter</i> of it at that time with a good
  <i>Telescope</i>, it is easie enough, by one single Observation of the
  apparent Diameter of the Moon with a good Glass, to determine her
  distances in any other part of her <i>Orbit</i>, or <i>Dragon</i>, and
  consequently, some few Observations will tell us, whether she be mov'd in
  an <i>Ellipsis</i>, (which, by the way, may also be found, even now,
  though I think we are yet ignorant of her true distance) and next (which
  without such Observations, I think, we shall not be sure of) we may know
  exactly the bigness of that <i>Ellipsis</i>, or Circle, and her true
  velocity in each part, and thereby be much the better inabled to find out
  the true cause of all her Motions. And though, even now also, we may, by
  such Observations in one station, as here at <i>London</i>, observe the
  <i>apparent Diameter</i> and motion of the Moon in her <i>Dragon</i>, and
  consequently be inabled to make a better ghess at the <i>Species</i> or
  kind of Curve, in which she is mov'd, that is, whether it be sphærical,
  or <i>elliptical</i>, or neither, and with what proportional velocities
  she is carried in that Curve; yet till her true <i>Parallax</i> be known,
  we cannot determine either.</p>

  <p>Next, for the true distance of the Sun, the best way will be, by
  accurate Observations, made in both these forementioned stations, of some
  convenient Eclipse of the Sun, many of which may so happen, as to be seen
  by both; for the <i>Penumbra</i> of the Moon may, if she be sixty
  Semidiameters distant from the Earth, and the Sun above seven thousand,
  extend to about seventy degrees on the Earth, and consequently be seen by
  Observators as far distant as <i>London</i>, and St. <i>Helena</i>, which
  are not full sixty nine degrees distant. And this would much more
  accurately, then any way that has been yet used, determine the Parallax,
  and distance, of the Sun; for as for the Horizontal Parallax I have
  already shewn it sufficiently uncertain; nor is the way of finding it by
  the Eclipse of the Moon any other then hypothetical; and that by the
  difference of the true and apparent quadrature of the Moon is not less
  uncertain, witness their Deductions from it, who have made use of it; for
  <i>Vendeline</i> puts that difference to be but 4'.30". whence he deduces
  a vast distance of the Sun, as I have before shewn. <i>Ricciolo</i> makes
  it full 30'.00. but <i>Reinoldus</i>, and <i>Kircher</i>, no less then
  three degrees. And no wonder, for if we examine the <i>Theory</i>, we
  shall find it so complicated with uncertainties.</p>

  <p>First, From the irregular surface of the Moon, and from several
  Parallaxes, that unless the <i>Dichotomy</i> happen in the
  <i>Nonagesimus</i> of the <i>Ecliptick</i>, and that in the Meridian,
  <i>&amp;c.</i> all which happen so very seldom, that it is almost
  impossible to make them otherwise then uncertainly. Besides, we are not
  yet certain, but that there may be somewhat about the Moon
  <i>analogus</i> to the Air about the Earth, which may cause a refraction
  of the light of the Sun, and consequently make a great difference in the
  apparent <i>dichotomy</i> of the Moon. Their way indeed is very rational
  and ingenious; and such as is much to be preferred before the way by the
  Horizontal Parallax, could all the uncertainties be remov'd, and were the
  true distance of the Moon known.</p>

  <p>But because we find by the Experiments of <i>Vendiline</i>,
  <i>Reinoldus</i>, &amp;c. that Observations of this kind are very
  uncertain also: It were to be wisht, that such kind of Observations, made
  at two very distant stations, were promoted. And it is so much the more
  desirable, because, from what I have now shewn of the nature of the Air,
  it is evident, that the refraction may be very much greater then all the
  Astronomers hitherto have imagined it: And consequently, that the
  distance of the Moon, and other Planets, may be much lesse then what they
  have hitherto made it.</p>

  <p>For first, this Inflection, I have here propounded, will allow the
  shadow of the Earth to be much shorter then it can be made by the other
  <i>Hypothesis</i> of refraction, and consequently, the Moon will not
  suffer an Eclipse, unless it comes very much nearer the Earth then the
  Astronomers hitherto have supposed it.</p>

  <p>Secondly, There will not in this <i>Hypothesis</i> be any other shadow
  of the Earth, such as <i>Kepler</i> supposes, and calls the
  <i>Penumbra</i>, which is the shadow of the refracting <i>Atmosphere</i>;
  for the bending of the Rays being altogether caus'd by <i>Inflection</i>,
  as I have already shewn, all that part which is ascribed by
  <i>Kepler</i>, and others after him, to the <i>Penumbra</i>, or dark
  part, which is without the <i>umbra terræ</i>, does clear vanish; for in
  this <i>Hypothesis</i> there is no refracting surface of the Air, and
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-37.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 37.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> 9.
</span>
  consequently there can be no shadows, such as appear in the ninth Figure
  of the 37. <i>Scheme</i>, where let ABCD represent the Earth, and EFGH
  the <i>Atmosphere</i>, which according to <i>Keplers</i> supposition, is
  like a Sphære of Water terminated with an exact surface EFGH, let the
  lines MF, LB, ID, KH, represent the Rays of the Sun; 'tis manifest, that
  all the Rayes between LB, and ID, will be reflected by the surface of the
  Earth BAD, and consequently, the conical space BOD would be dark and
  obscure; but, say the followers of <i>Kepler</i>, the Rays between MF,
  and LB, and between ID, and KH, falling on the <i>Atmosphere</i>, are
  refracted, both at their ingress and egress out of the <i>Atmosphere</i>,
  nearer towards the Axis of the sphærical shadow CO, and consequently,
  inlighten a great part of that former dark Cone, and shorten, and
  contract, its top to N. And because of this Reflection of these Rays, say
  they, there is superinduc'd another shell of a dark Cone FPH, whose Apex
  P is yet further distant from the Earth: By this <i>Penumbra</i>, say
  they, the Moon is Eclipsed, for it alwayes passes between
  the lines 12, and 34.</p>

  <p>To which I say, That if the Air be such, as I have newly shewn it to
  be, and consequently cause such an inflection of the Rays that fall into
  it, those dark <i>Penumbra's</i> FYZQ, HXVT, and ORPS, will all vanish.
  For if we suppose the Air indefinitely extended, and to be no where
  bounded with a determinate refracting surface, as I have shewn it
  uncapable of having, from the nature of it; it will follow, that the Moon
  will no where be totally obscured, but when it is below the Apex N, of
  the dark blunt Cone of the Earth's shadow: Now, from the supposition,
  that the Sun is distant about seven thousand Diameters, the point N,
  according to calculation, being not above twenty five terrestrial
  Semidiameters from the Center of the Earth: It follows, that whensoever
  the Moon eclipsed is totally darkned, without affording any kind of
  light, it must be within twenty five Semidiameters of the Earth, and
  consequently much lower then any Astronomers have hitherto put it.</p>

  <p>This will seem much more consonant to the rest of the secundary
  Planets; for the highest of <i>Jupiter's</i> Moons is between twenty and
  thirty <i>Jovial Semidiameters</i> distant from the Center of
  <i>Jupiter</i>; and the Moons of <i>Saturn</i> much about the same number
  of <i>Saturnial Semidiameters</i> from the Center of that Planet.</p>

  <p>But these are but conjectures also, and must be determin'd by such
  kind of Observations as I have newly mention'd.</p>

  <p>Nor will it be difficult, by this <i>Hypothesis</i>, to salve all the
  appearances of Eclipses of the Moon, for in this <i>Hypothesis</i> also,
  there will be on each side of the shadow of the Earth, a <i>Penumbra</i>,
  not caus'd by the Refraction of the Air, as in the <i>Hypothesis</i> of
  <i>Kepler</i>; but by the faint inlightning of it by the Sun: For if, in
  the sixth Figure, we suppose ESQ, and GSR, to be the Rays that terminate
  the shadow from either side of the Earth; ESQ coming from the upper limb
  of the Sun, and GSR from the under; it will follow, that the shadow of
  the Earth, within those Rays, that is, the Cone GSE, will be totally
  dark. But the Sun being not a point, but a large <i>area</i> of light,
  there will be a secondary dark Cone of shadow EPG, which will be caus'd
  by the earth's hindring part of the Rays of the Sun from falling on the
  parts GPR, and EPQ, of which halved shadow, or <i>Penumbra</i>, that part
  will appear brightest which lyes nearest the terminating Rayes GP, and
  EP, and those darker that lye nearest to GS, and ES: when therefore the
  Moon appears quite dark in the middle of the Eclipse, she must be below
  S, that is, between S and F; when she appears lighter near the middle of
  the Eclipse, she must pass some where between RQ and S; and when she is
  alike light through the whole Eclypse, she must pass between RQ, and
  P.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsLIX" id="obsLIX">LIX</a>. <i>Of multitudes of small </i>Stars<i> discoverable by the
</i>Telescope<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Having, in the last Observation, premis'd some particulars observable
  in the <i>medium</i>, through which we must look upon
  <i>C&#339;lestial</i> Objects, I shall here add one Observation of the
  Bodies themselves; and for a <i>specimen</i> I have made choice of the
  <i>Pleiades</i>, or seven Stars, commonly so called (though in our time
  and Climate there appear no more then six to the naked eye) and this I
  did the rather, because the deservedly famous <i>Galileo</i>, having
  publisht a Picture of this <i>Asterisme</i>, was able, it seems, with his
  Glass to discover no more then thirty six, whereas with a pretty good
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-38.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 38.</a>
</span>
  twelve foot <i>Telescope</i>, by which I drew this 38 <i>Iconism</i>, I
  could very plainly discover seventy eight, placed in the order they are
  ranged in the Figure, and of as many differing Magnitudes as the
  <i>Asterisks</i>, wherewith they are Marked, do specifie; there being no
  less then fourteen several Magnitudes of those Stars, which are compris'd
  within the draught, the biggest whereof is not accounted greater then one
  of the third Magnitude; and indeed that account is much too big, if it be
  compared with other Stars of the third Magnitude, especially by the help
  of a <i>Telescope</i>; for then by it may be perceiv'd, that its
  splendor, to the naked eye, may be somewhat augmented by the three little
  Stars immediately above it, which are near adjoyning to it. The
  <i>Telescope</i> also discovers a great variety, even in the bigness of
  those, commonly reckon'd, of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and
  sixth Magnitude; so that should they be distinguish'd thereby, those six
  Magnitudes would, at least, afford no less then thrice that number of
  Magnitudes, plainly enough distinguishable by their Magnitude, and
  brightness; so that a good twelve foot Glass would afford us no less then
  twenty five several Magnitudes. Nor are these all, but a longer Glass
  does yet further, both more nicely distinguish the Magnitudes of those
  already noted, and also discover several other of smaller Magnitudes, not
  discernable by the twelve foot Glass: Thus have I been able, with a good
  thirty six foot Glass, to discover many more Stars in the <i>Pleiades</i>
  then are here delineated, and those of three or four distinct Magnitudes
  less then any of those spots of the fourteenth Magnitude. And by the
  twinkling of divers other places of this <i>Asterisme</i>, when the Sky
  was very clear, I am apt to think, that with longer Glasses, or such as
  would bear a bigger <i>aperture</i>, there might be discovered multitudes
  of other small Stars, yet inconspicuous. And indeed, for the discovery of
  small Stars, the bigger the <i>aperture</i> be, the better adapted is the
  Glass; for though perhaps it does make the several specks more radiant,
  and glaring, yet by that means, uniting more Rays very near to one point,
  it does make many of those radiant points conspicuous,   which, by putting on a less <i>aperture</i>, may be found to vanish; and
  therefore, both for the discovery of the fixt Star, and for finding the
  <i>Satellites</i> of <i>Jupiter</i>, before it be out of the day, or
  twilight, I alwayes leave the Object-glass as clear without any
  <i>aperture</i> as I can, and have thereby been able to discover the
  <i>Satellites</i> a long while before; I was able to discern them, when
  the smaller <i>apertures</i> were put on; and at other times, to see
  multitudes of other smaller Stars, which a smaller <i>aperture</i> makes
  to disappear.</p>

  <p>In that notable <i>Asterism</i> also of the Sword of <i>Orion</i>,
  where the ingenious Monsieur <i>Hugens van Zulichem</i> has discovered
  only three little Stars in a cluster, I have with a thirty six foot
  Glass, without any <i>aperture</i> (the breadth of the Glass being about
  some three inches and a half) discover'd five, and the twinkling of
  divers others up and down in divers parts of that small milky Cloud.</p>

  <p>So that 'tis not unlikely, but that the meliorating of
  <i>Telescopes</i> will afford as great a variety of new Discoveries in
  the Heavens, as better <i>Microscopes</i> would among small terrestrial
  Bodies, and both would give us infinite cause, more and more to admire
  the omnipotence of the Creator.</p>

<h3>Observ. <a name="obsLX" id="obsLX">LX</a>. <i>Of the </i>Moon<i>.</i></h3>

  <p>Having a pretty large corner of the Plate for the seven Starrs, void,
  for the filling it up, I have added one small <i>Specimen</i> of the
  appearance of the parts of the Moon, by describing a small spot of it,
  which, though taken notice of, both by the Excellent <i>Hevelius</i>, and
  called <i>Mons Olympus</i> (though I think somewhat improperly, being
<span class="sidenote">
<a href="images/scheme-38.png" target="_blank"><i>Schem.</i> 38.</a><br /><i>Fig.</i> X, <i>&amp;c</i>.
</span>
  rather a vale) and represented by the Figure X. of the 38. <i>Scheme</i>,
  and also by the Learn'd <i>Ricciolus</i>, who calls it <i>Hipparchus</i>,
  and describes it by the Figure Y, yet how far short both of them come of
  the truth, may be somewhat perceiv'd by the draught, which I have here
  added of it, in the Figure Z, (which I drew by a thirty foot Glass, in
  <i>October</i> 1664. just before the Moon was half inlightned) but much
  better by the Reader's diligently observing it himself, at a convenient
  time, with a Glass of that length, and much better yet with one of
  threescore foot long, for through these it appears a very spacious Vale,
  incompassed with a ridge of Hills, not very high in comparison of many
  other in the Moon, nor yet very steep. The Vale it self ABCD, is much of
  the figure of a Pear, and from several appearances of it, seems to be
  some very fruitful place, that is, to have its surface all covered over
  with some kinds of vegetable substances; for in all positions of the
  light on it, it seems to give a much fainter reflection then the more
  barren tops of the incompassing Hills, and those a much fainter then
  divers other cragged, chalky, or rocky Mountains of the Moon. So that I
  am not unapt to think, that the Vale may have
  Vegetables <i>analogus</i> to our Grass, Shrubs, and Trees; and most of
  these incompassing Hills may be covered with so thin a vegetable Coat, as
  we may observe the Hills with us to be, such as the short Sheep pasture
  which covers the Hills of <i>Salisbury</i> Plains.</p>

  <p>Up and down in several parts of this place here describ'd (as there
  are multitudes in other places all over the surface of the Moon) may be
  perceived several kinds of pits, which are shap'd almost like a dish,
  some bigger, some less, some shallower, some deeper, that is, they seem
  to be a hollow <i>Hemisphere</i>, incompassed with a round rising bank,
  as if the substance in the middle had been digg'd up, and thrown on
  either side. These seem to me to have been the effects of some motions
  within the body of the Moon, <i>analogus</i> to our Earthquakes, by the
  eruption of which, as it has thrown up a brim, or ridge, round about,
  higher then the Ambient surface of the Moon, so has it left a hole, or
  depression, in the middle, proportionably lower; divers places resembling
  some of these, I have observ'd here in <i>England</i>, on the tops of
  some Hills, which might have been caus'd by some Earthquake in the
  younger dayes of the world. But that which does most incline me to this
  belief, is, first, the generality and diversity of the Magnitude of these
  pits all over the body of the Moon. Next, the two experimental wayes, by
  which I have made a representation of them.</p>

  <p>The first was with a very soft and well temper'd mixture of
  Tobacco-pipe clay and Water, into which, if I let fall any heavy body, as
  a Bullet, it would throw up the mixture round the place, which for a
  while would make a representation, not unlike these of the Moon; but
  considering the state and condition of the Moon, there seems not any
  probability to imagine, that it should proceed from any cause
  <i>analogus</i> to this; for it would be difficult to imagine whence
  those bodies should come; and next, how the substance of the Moon should
  be so soft; but if a Bubble be blown under the surface of it, and
  suffer'd to rise, and break; or if a Bullet, or other body, sunk in it,
  be pull'd out from it, these departing bodies leave an impression on the
  surface of the mixture, exactly like these of the Moon, save that these
  also quickly subside and vanish. But the second, and most notable,
  representation was, what I observ'd in a pot of boyling Alabaster, for
  there that powder being by the eruption of vapours reduc'd to a kind of
  fluid consistence, if, whil'st it boyls, it be gently remov'd besides the
  fire, the Alabaster presently ceasing to boyl, the whole surface,
  especially that where some of the last Bubbles have risen, will appear
  all over covered with small pits, exactly shap'd like these of the Moon,
  and by holding a lighted Candle in a large dark Room, in divers positions
  to this surface, you may exactly represent all the <i>Phænomena</i> of
  these pits in the Moon, according as they are more or less inlightned by
  the Sun.</p>

  <p>And that there may have been in the Moon some such motion as this,
  which may have made these pits, will seem the more probable, if we
  suppose it like our Earth, for the Earthquakes here with us seem to
  proceed from some such cause, as the boyling of the pot of Alabaster,
  there seeming to be generated in the Earth
  from some subterraneous fires, or heat, great quantities of vapours, that
  is, of expanded aerial substances, which not presently finding a passage
  through the ambient parts of the Earth, do, as they are increased by the
  supplying and generating principles, and thereby (having not sufficient
  room to expand themselves) extreamly condens'd, at last overpower, with
  their <i>elastick</i> properties, the resistence of the incompassing
  Earth, and lifting it up, or cleaving it, and so shattering of the parts
  of the Earth above it, do at length, where they find the parts of the
  Earth above them more loose, make their way upwards, and carrying a great
  part of the Earth before them, not only raise a small brim round about
  the place, out of which they break, but for the most part considerable
  high Hills and Mountains, and when they break from under the Sea, divers
  times, mountainous Islands; this seems confirm'd by the <i>Vulcans</i> in
  several places of the Earth, the mouths of which, for the most part, are
  incompassed with a Hill of a considerable height, and the tops of those
  Hills, or Mountains, are usually shap'd very much like these pits, or
  dishes, of the Moon: Instances of this we have in the descriptions of
  <i>Ætna</i> in <i>Sicily</i>, of <i>Hecla</i> in <i>Iceland</i>, of
  <i>Tenerif</i> in the <i>Canaries</i>, of the several <i>Vulcans</i> in
  <i>New-Spain</i>, describ'd by <i>Gage</i>, and more especially in the
  eruption of late years in one of the <i>Canary</i> Islands. In all of
  which there is not only a considerable high Hill raised about the mouth
  of the <i>Vulcan</i>, but, like the spots of the Moon, the top of those
  Hills are like a dish, or bason. And indeed, if one attentively consider
  the nature of the thing, one may find sufficient reason to judge, that it
  cannot be otherwise; for these eruptions, whether of fire, or smoak,
  alwayes raysing great quantities of Earth before them, must necessarily,
  by the fall of those parts on either side, raise very considerable
  heaps.</p>

  <p>Now, both from the figures of them, and from several other
  circumstances; these pits in the Moon seem to have been generated much
  after the same manner that the holes in Alabaster, and the <i>Vulcans</i>
  of the Earth are made. For first, it is not improbable, but that the
  substance of the Moon may be very much like that of our Earth, that is,
  may consist of an earthy, sandy, or rocky substance, in several of its
  superficial parts, which parts being agitated, undermin'd, or heav'd up,
  by eruptions of vapours, may naturally be thrown into the same kind of
  figured holes, as the small dust, or powder of Alabaster. Next, it is not
  improbable, but that there may be generated, within the body of the Moon,
  divers such kind of internal fires and heats, as may produce such
  Exhalations; for since we can plainly enough discover with a
  <i>Telescope</i>, that there are multitudes of such kind of eruptions in
  the body of the Sun it self, which is accounted the most noble Ætherial
  body, certainly we need not be much scandaliz'd at such kind of
  alterations, or corruptions, in the body of this lower and less
  considerable part of the universe, the Moon, which is only secundary, or
  attendant, on the bigger, and more considerable body of the Earth.
  Thirdly, 'tis not unlikely, but that supposing such a sandy or mouldring
  substance to be there found, and supposing also a
  possibility of the generation of the internal <i>elastical</i> body
  (whether you will call it air or vapours) 'tis not unlikely, I say, but
  that there is in the Moon a principle of gravitation, such as in the
  Earth. And to make this probable, I think, we need no better Argument,
  then the roundness, or globular Figure of the body of the Moon it self,
  which we may perceive very plainly by the <i>Telescope</i>, to be (bating
  the small inequality of the Hills and Vales in it, which are all of them
  likewise shap'd, or levelled, as it were, to answer to the center of the
  Moons body) perfectly of a Sphærical figure, that is, all the parts of it
  are so rang'd (bating the comparitively small ruggedness of the Hills and
  Dales) that the outmost bounds of them are equally distant from the
  Center of the Moon, and consequently, it is exceedingly probable also,
  that they are equidistant from the Center of gravitation; and indeed, the
  figure of the superficial parts of the Moon are so exactly shap'd,
  according as they should be, supposing it had a gravitating principle as
  the Earth has, that even the figure of those parts themselves is of
  sufficient efficacy to make the gravitation, and the other two
  suppositions probable: so that the other suppositions may be rather
  prov'd by this considerable Circumstance, or Observation, then this
  suppos'd Explication can by them; for he that shall attentively observe
  with an excellent <i>Telescope</i>, how all the Circumstances, notable in
  the shape of the superficial parts, are, as it were, exactly adapted to
  suit with such a principle, will, if he well considers the usual method
  of Nature in its other proceedings, find abundant argument to believe it
  to have really there also such a principle; for I could never observe,
  among all the mountainous or prominent parts of the Moon (whereof there
  is a huge variety) that any one part of it was plac'd in such a manner,
  that if there should be a gravitating, or attracting principle in the
  body of the Moon, it would make that part to fall, or be mov'd out of its
  visible posture. Next, the shape and position of the parts is such, that
  they all seem put into those very shapes they are in by a gravitating
  power: For first, there are but very few clifts, or very steep
  declivities in the ascent of these Mountains; for besides those
  Mountains, which are by <i>Hevelius</i> call'd the <i>Apennine</i>
  Mountains, and some other, which seem to border on the Seas of the Moon,
  and those only upon one side, as is common also in those Hills that are
  here on the Earth; there are very few that seem to have very steep
  ascents, but, for the most part, they are made very round, and much
  resemble the make of the Hills and Mountains also of the Earth; this may
  be partly perceived by the Hills incompassing this Vale, which I have
  here describ'd; and as on the Earth also, the middlemost of these Hills
  seems the highest, so is it obvious also, through a good
  <i>Telescope</i>, in those of the Moon; the Vales also in many are much
  shap'd like those of the Earth, and I am apt to think, that could we look
  upon the Earth from the Moon, with a good <i>Telescope</i>, we might
  easily enough perceive its surface to be very much like that of the
  Moon.</p>

  <p>Now whereas in this small draught, (as there would be multitudes if
  the whole Moon were drawn after this manner) there are several little
  Ebullitions, or Dishes, even in the Vales
  themselves, and in the incompassing Hills also; this will, from this
  supposition, (which I have, I think, upon very good reason taken) be
  exceeding easily explicable; for, as I have several times also observ'd,
  in the surface of Alabaster so ordered, as I before describ'd, so may the
  later eruptions of vapours be even in the middle, or on the edges of the
  former; and other succeeding these also in time may be in the middle or
  edges of these, <i>&amp;c.</i> of which there are Instances enough in
  divers parts of the body of the Moon, and by a boyling pot of Alabaster
  will be sufficiently exemplifi'd.</p>

  <p>To conclude therefore, it being very probable, that the Moon has a
  principle of gravitation, it affords an excellent distinguishing Instance
  in the search after the cause of gravitation, or attraction, to hint,
  that it does not depend upon the diurnal or turbinated motion of the
  Earth, as some have somewhat inconsiderately supposed and affirmed it to
  do; for if the Moon has an attractive principle, whereby it is not only
  shap'd round, but does firmly contain and hold all its parts united,
  though many of them seem as loose as the sand on the Earth, and that the
  Moon is not mov'd about its Center; then certainly the turbination cannot
  be the cause of the attraction of the Earth, and therefore some other
  principle must be thought of, that will agree with all the secundary as
  well as primary Planets. But this, I confess, is but a probability, and
  not a demonstration, which (from any Observation yet made) it seems
  hardly capable of, though how successful future indeavours (promoted by
  the meliorating of Glasses, and observing particular circumstances) may
  be in this, or any other, kind, must be with patience expected.</p>

  <p>Observ. <a href="#obsIX">9</a>. Of Fantastical Colours.</p>

  <p><i>The texture of </i>Muscovy<i> Glass; its Figures: what other Bodies
  are like it: that it exhibits several colours, and how: several
  Observations and Experiments about those colours: the reason why on this
  occasion the nature of colours is inquir'd into. A conjecture at the
  reason of these colours explicated by several Experiments and Reasons:
  First, by continual cleaving the Body till it become colour'd. Secondly,
  by producing all kinds of colours with two flat Plates of Glass. Thirdly,
  by blowing Glass so thin in the Lamp, till it produce the same effect.
  Fourthly, by doing the same with Bubbles of divers other transparent
  Bodies: the reasons of the colours on nealed Steel, where by the way the
  causes of the hardning and tempering of Steel,
  endeavour'd to be shewn and explicated by several Reasons and
  Experiments: the reason of the colours on Lead, Brass, Copper, Silver,
  </i>&amp;c.<i> other Instances of such colour'd bodies in animal
  substances: several other distinguishing Observations. </i>Des Cartes
  Hypothesis<i> of Colours examin'd. An </i>Hypothesis<i> for the
  explication of light by motion, indeavoured to be explicated and
  determined by several Reasons and Experiments: three distinguishing
  Properties of the motion of light. The distinguishing Properties of a
  trasparent </i>Medium<i> [that there seems to be no Experiment that
  proves the Instantaneous motion of light] the manner of the propagation
  of light through them. Of the </i>homogeniety<i> and </i>heterogeniety<i>
  of transparent </i>Mediums<i>, and what effects they cause on the Rayes
  of light, explicated by a Figure: an Examination of the refraction of the
  Rays by a plain Surface, which causes Colours. An Examination of the like
  effects produced by a spherical Surface: the use that may be made of
  these Experiments, for the examination of several </i>Hypotheses<i> of
  Colours. </i>Des Cartes Hypothesis<i> examin'd. Some Difficulties taken
  notice of in it. What seems most likely to be the cause of colour: that
  propriety is indeavoured to be shewn in a Glass ball: that the reflection
  is not necessary to produce Colours nor a double refraction: the
  </i>Hypothesis<i> further examined, both in the </i>pellucid Medium<i>

  <p><i>That all Colours seem to be caus'd by refraction. An

  hereby explicated: how many wayes such Chymical Liquors may alter the
  colours of Bodies. Objections made against this </i>Hypothesis<i> of two
  colours only, indeavoured to be answer'd, by several Reasons and
  Experiments. The reason why some Colours are capable of being diluted,
  others not: what those are: that probably the particles of most metalline
  Colours are transparent; for this several Arguments and Observations are
  recited: how Colours become incapable of diluting, explicated by a
  Similitude. An Instrument, by which one and the same coloured Liquor at
  once exhibited all the degrees of colours between the palest yellow and
  deepest red: as likewise another that exhibited all varieties of blues:
  several Experiments try'd with these Boxes. An Objection drawn from the
  nature of Painters colours answered: that diluting and whitening a colour
  are different operations; as are deepening and blackening: why some may
  be diluted by grinding, and some other by being tempered with Oyl:
  several Experiments for the explicating of some former Assertions: why
  Painters are forced to make use of many colours: what those colours are:
  and how mixt. The conclusion, that most coloured Bodies seem to consist
  of transparent particles: that all colours dissoluble in Liquors are
  capable of diluting: some of mixing, what a strange variety may thereby
  be produc'd.</i></p>

  are of differing density: some Experiments to prove this. A Table of the
  strength of the spring of the Air, answering to each degree of extension;
  when first made, and when repeated. Another Experiment of compressing the

  inferr'd; and several </i>Phænomena<i> explain'd. That the Air near the

  that of the surface of boyl'd Alabaster dust seeming the most likely to

  Earthquakes seem to be generated much the same way, and their effects
  seem very similar. An Argument that there may be such variations in the
  Moon, because greater have been observ'd in the Sun: because substance of
  the Moon and Earth seem much alike: and because 'tis probable the Moon
  has a gravitating principle: this is argued from several particulars. The

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.org/license">http://gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
